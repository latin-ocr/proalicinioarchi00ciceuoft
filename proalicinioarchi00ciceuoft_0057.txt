the form of a question 3 see n. on 30, p. 32, l. 2. The first sentence osten

Nos .· this is generally taken to be a contrast not of sense, but οἱ
mere rhetorical form, to ille. May the contrast not really lie between

Animorum motus celeritatemque ingem’omm .· “mental activity and
natural quickness”. The plural motus, as is the mse with many other
Latin plurals, can best be rendered by an abstract noun in Eng. The
difference between animus and ingenium is very slight3 a. here includes
mental qualities s ecially due to cultivation, i. those which are the
gists of nature. gf. De Or. 1 1¹3 animi atque ingeni celeres quidam
motus esse debent. The ancients regarded quickness of movement or
change to be the characteristic by which the mind (looked on by all
men in Cic-'s time as a material substance) was particularly distinguished
srom other substances. See especially Tusc. 1 5 3 sq.

Agerentur: the subjunctive is not easy to explain. (1) It may be
regarded as limiting the expression eis ipsis rebus. Such subjunctives
are often introduced by qui quidem, qui modo, and the like. A
striking instance is Acad. 1 22 Academicos, qui tum appellarentur ;
see others in Roby's Gram. ἓ 1692. Here, however, it must be ad-
mitted that the notion of limitation is very saint. (2) Cic. although
he is relating his own past experiences, may have carelessly put the
verb in the subj. as though he were reporting a statement made by some
one else. This seems to be the case in 25, 1. 20 (fecuset) where see
n. (3) There may be no other reason for the subj. but the fact that
there is another verb (smpsisset) in the same mood in the same sentence.

, Such attracted subjunctives are common in Cic.; e. g. in De Nat. D.

Eandem rem dicere:=de eadem re d. It is necessary to note this,
otherwise commutatis sententiis· will seem to involve a contradiction.
So dicam Alciden puerosque Ledam—dicam horrida bella etc.
