36 PRO ARCHIA POETA. §3.

on leges or statutes) to distinguish them from the quaestiones extraordi-
nariae, temporary criminal commissions, which were sometimes ap·
pointed at Rome. The same courts are called iudicia publica, to
distinguish them from the iudicia privata, or civil courts. s

Praetorem: see Introd. p. 16. .
Rectissimum .· “most upright’'. See Appendix B, p. 78.

conventu: this word is especially used of a crowd attendant on a
law-court ; hence it has the meaning of Eng. “assize'', or even “assize-
town''‚ or “circuit”. For examples see Dictt. Notice the order of
the words conventu hominum ac frequentia ,· the collocation conventu ac
frequentia hominum would be contrary to Cic.’s usage.

Consuetudine iudiciorum: so Brut. 120, but for this we have in
32 iudiciali consuetudine, just as we have forensi sermone here for
jori sermone. This substitution of the adjective for the genitive of
the noun is especially common in Cic. [See Wichert's excellent
pamphlet Ueber den Gebrauch des Ad J ectivischen Attributs, etc. Berlin,
1875]

Verum etiam .· this after non modo is rarer than sed etiam, which,
according to Stuerenburg, is the only form found in Caesar, Livy, and
Tacitus.

Quaeso a vobis .· here begins the apodosis ; strictly speaking, after
ne cui mirum videatur etc., a statement of fact such as accommodatum
est kuic reo ought to come.

Vobis non molestam: a modern would insert before vobis an adver·
sative particle such as sed, but the omission is common in Latin3 cf.
Ad Att. X111 52 habes hospitium sive ἐπιστὰθμίαν odiosam—mihi,
dixi, non molestam.

ιο Concursu—humanz'tate: look closely at these ablatives ; they belong

to that division of modal ablatives which are sometimes called “ablatives
of attendant circumstances ''. Cf. Ad Fam. XVI 9, ἰ inde austro lenissimo,
caelo sereno pervenimus. The so-called ablative absolute really is of the
same nature. [Roby, Gram.§ 124o.]

Exercente iudicium : the phrase is technical‚ and used of the pre-
siding judge10nly3 so 32, 1. 33.

patiamini: this is pleonastic after ut detis hanc veniam above;
Halm quotes permittere ut liceat from Pro Tullio 47.

In eius modi persona .· some editors err by applying these words
to Cicero himself, ³3 though they meant “speaking :ts-l do in a

was unfamiliar to the courts, although lawyers were osten describing
other general types, e. g. the widows' attorney as sketched in Pro
Caecina 14 where persona is used as here. Each typical character on
the stage, the old man, the young man, the parasite, had his peculiar
mask (persona).

14 Iudiciis pmkulztrque: “ courts ,and criminal trials” ; iudicia form

the class of which pericula (see n. on 13 1. 8) are a subdivision.
