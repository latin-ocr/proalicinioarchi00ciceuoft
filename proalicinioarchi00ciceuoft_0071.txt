APPENDIX A.

ΟΝ SOME ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE GENUINENESS
OF THE SPEECH PRO ARCHIA.

The speech has been attacked on two sides, the aesthetic side
and the linguistic side. The first line of attack 1 have noticed, so
far as 1 think necessary, in the Introduction. Ι now deal with those
rare or unique words or phrases which many scholars have asserted
not to be from Cicero's hand. Before approaching this subject directly,
it is well to observe that the external evidence in favour of the speech
is unusually strong. It is quite certain that Cicero did deliver a speech
sor Archias3 it is also certain that the speech we possess passed sor
the original speech at least as early as the middle os the first century

- A.D., and was never questioned till recent times. Mox-cover, no one

can point to a trace of the existence of any· other speech, which might
” be the one Cicero really wrote. The task of proving on internal
grounds the oration sor Archias to be spurious is therefore sar harder
than that of demolishing other Ciceronian sorgeries, such sor example,
as the invective against Sallust, which has not a tittle of external
evidence in its favour. The reasons founded on the language of this
speech must be strong and clear to lead us to reject it.

The expressions in the Pro Archia on which suspicion has been
cast are‘either such as do not occur at all excepting in the speech
itself, or such as are not used by Cicero elsewhere, though they occur
in other writers of the classical period os Latin literature. Now

arguments against the genuineness os a speech based on the rare
occurrence os phrases in it are useless unless it can be shewn that the
phrases are in their own nature foreign to the genius of the Latin
languagq or are in themselves such as there is strong reason sor
believing that the author would not use. The mere rarity os the
expressions may be the result of accident. There are numerous ἅπαξ
λεγόμενα in Cicero, and some at least in every other author, which
