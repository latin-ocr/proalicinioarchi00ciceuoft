66 PRO ARCHIA POETA. § 31.

artibus. The use of causa as a qualitative abl. is noticeable, since
causa cannot by any stretch be regarded as a quality residing in a man.
Stuerenburg quotes a number of passages, among them Tusc. 1 85
Metellus ille honoratis quattuorfilz‘zzv‚ but none so unusual as this of ours.

17 Beneficio legis: “the favour conferred by the 1aw'’; so 11 Phil. 56
(where Halm misinterprets the phrase), In Vat. 27 ut homo consularis
spoliaretur beneficio et aequitate legis· tuac, De Leg. Agr. 11 61, Acad.
11 1 legis praemio. For the allusion see 7, for auctoritate municipi 8,
for testimonium Luculli 8, for tabulis Metelli 9.

’.νο Divina : see 18, 1. 9.

21 Debet esse: with this collocation the emphasis is on esse: with the
other collocation esse debet, it is on debet. The same rule holds with
esse potest and potest esse. Kiihner is wrong when he says (on Tusc.
11 110) that esse potest is of excessive rarity in Cic.‚ and assigns as a
reason Cie.’s desire to avoid the rhythm of the pentameter ending. Ι
have marked every passage in the letters to Atticus in which either
esse potest or potest csse or similar phrases occur, and I find that the
two collocations are about equally common. See a n. of mine on
Acad. 11 22.

23 Periculis .· really :nobis vobisque qui sumus periclitati. For a similar
3¹22] cf. Pro Plane. 50 quorum dignitati populus Romanus testimonium

25 Ex eo numero qui: so Cic. nearly always for ex eorum numero qui.
which according to Stuerenburg only occurs in De Or. 11 56. Cf. In ,
Vat. 41 in illorum numero. Cic. seems to say esse cx numero and
esse in numero indifferently.

26 Itaque: =et ita ; common in Cic.

28 Causa .· here=the bare facts of a case, and the technical legal
arguments founded on them ; the more remote considerations arising out

is already passed in the minds of the jury3 to this fact the past in·
finitive testifies. The announcement of the approval is, however, still
in the future, and it is to this that spero strictly refers. So Ad Att. V111
3, 7 est quaedam spes Afranium cum Trebonio pugnasse.

ἓ 32.

30 Quae.·=all that is extra causam ; forfirc cf. prope in 3, 1. 15.

A mea .·=aliena a mea, as in the phrase ab re=away from the
matter. So from is used in Shakespeaoe, as Hamlet 111 2, 22 anytln‘ng
so werdone is from tlte purpose of playing. For the reading see
Appendix B p. 79.

Iudiciali: n. on 3, l. 6. Cf. Brut. 120 consuetudo iudiciorum.

31 Communiter:=generally about literature, which is Archias’ pursuit.
The contrast to com. is proprie, which is unexpressed.

33 Exercet: n. on 3, l. 12.
