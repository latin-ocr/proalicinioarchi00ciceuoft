ΟΝ ΤΗΕ ΤΕΧΤ OF THE PRO ARCHIA.

Any discussion of the relative value of MSS and any full enumeratio„
of readings would be foreign to the purpose of this edition. My inten-
tion is not to present a critical apparatus but to use textual discussions
so as to promote the exact knowledge of Latin among those junior
students for whom the work is designed.

Ι. Orthogyapby.

1. compound words. Most editors os Latin texts err by running
together words which ought to be kept distinct. Unless the evidence is
clear that the Latins of Cicero's time habitually spoke and wrote two
words so as to form one, these words should be kept asunder, and it is
better to do so when the practice of the Latins was not unisorm. Most
of the evidence attainable comes from inscriptions or from the Latin
Grammarians, with Priscian at their head. The latter kind of evidence
is notoriously untrustvmrthy, and where it does not receive support from
other sources, cannot be valued highly.

α. About adeo (ἓ 13), quoad (ἓ 1), nisi, etenim (ξ 2) no doubt exists.

b. In the following instances it can be shewn from inscriptions that
Latin usage varied—si or ne followed by quis and other cases of the
indefinite relative, tantum modo (ξ 2 5), non nullus (ξ ι), inprimis (5 Ι).
With regard to in primis, it may be mentioned that in all ages of Latin
prepositions were often run together with the cases they govemed, so as
to form compounds‚ but in the Latin of the Republican period at least,
the preposition was generally kept distinct.

c. The evidence of the Grammarians in favour of quemadmodum
(ἓ 3), eiusmodi (ἕ 3), iamtum (ἓ 1 1), etiamtum (ἓ 5), quodsi (ἓ 1), verum·
tamen (ἓ 28) being unsupported, Ι prefer to write quem ad modum etc.

d. If cur is really derived from qua re, these two words were at
one time pronounced so as to form a single compound. But the con-
