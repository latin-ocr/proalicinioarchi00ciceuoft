the Roman empire to get leading statesmen to act as their
recognised patrous and champions in the capital. Very likely
there was some such connexion between the family of the Lu-
culli and the town of Heraclia, and it was partly with the inten-
tion of doing honour to their patrons that the burgesses enrolled
Archias among their number1.A1though Archias already pos-
sessed the freedom of several Graeco· Italian cities, some of
them more famous than Heraclia, he described himself hence-
forward as a citizen of Heraclia, in order to mark his affection
sor the Luculli ⁹.

Although living in close friendship with some of the noblest
Romans,Archias was still politically an alien at the capital. Rome
shewed during nearly her whole history a surprising readiness
to confer the franchise on whole communities, but it was almost
as difficult at Rome as it was at Athens in the days of her great-
ness, for individual soreigners to become full citizens. The Ita-
lian war however resulted (roughly speaking) in the enfran-
chisement of all ItalianS. In the year 90 B.C., while the war
was still going on, Ldulius Caesar (father of the dictator Caesar)

A carried a law which enfranchised all corporate communities in
¹ Italy, excepting those which had joined in the rebellion‚ provided
’ that the communities themselves formally consented to be incor-

porated -with the body of Roman burgesses³. Archias might

have obtained the citizenship under this law. He was on the

burgess-roll of Neapolis, Heraclia, Tarentum, Regium, and pro-
bably Locri Epizephyrii. Neapolis and Heraclia were at first
disinclined to accept the position offered them by Caesar's law,
because the conditions of the treaties which bound them to
Rome were exceptionally favourable4. But we know definitely
that Neapolis accepted the Julian law5, as in all probability did
the other four cities named above. However, in the following
year, 89 13. C.‚ a law passed by the tribunes, M. Plautius Sil-
