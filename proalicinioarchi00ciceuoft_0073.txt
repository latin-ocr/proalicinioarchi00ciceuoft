A PPENDIX A. 69

· Ad humanitatem informari. The passages quoted in my n. amply
justify the phrase.

Condzzlisit. uss contigit, which would introduce an unparalleled
construction. See n. in Appendix B. p. 8².

Tabularum fidem resignasset. Literally “had unsealed (or broken
open the seal on) the credit of the records’'. The question here is
this3 is this metaphor of a kind which Cic. could not have used? Now
the opposite of resignare is constgnare, which is a savourite word with
Cic. and certainly such a phrase as consignare fidem tabulis· is per-
missible. Again, solvere, exsolvere, which are synonymous in meaning
with meg-nare here, are frequently used in Latin with fidem, as in
Ovid Fasti 1 462 voti solverat ille fidem, Liv. 111 19, 1; xxvu 5, 6.
F urther dissolvere, oblitterare, words similar in literal meaning to
resignare, are (as Stuerenburg points out) used sreely in metaphorical
applications by Cic. So is oblinere.

§n

Rem’ncetur. Found' here only in Cic„ but there is no reason to
suppose that this is otherwise than accidental.

ξ 12.

Later-23· abdiderunt: here only in Cic. is obdere found with a simple
ablative, but enough hasbeen already said about the passage in the n.

§12

Suasirsem followed by infinitive, also obicere followed by in with
acc. instead of dative. ΤΙιε comments in the nn. sufficiently justify
these phrases.

Inflari. This is in meaning but little different from excitari which
precedes, as a reference to any good Dict. will shew. The fact that
inflare is only in this passage used of divine ins iration for afflare
is clearly accidental. Stuerenburg aptly quotes De iv. 1 12 instinctu
inflatuque dim‘no, as the MSS have it. Cogitate: here only in Cic. who,
however, has very many adverbs of the kind scarcely found elsewhere.

ς 19.

Suum vindicant: this is unique (see n.) but evidently genuine, as
the context shews. It may well be justified as a natural though ex·

oeptional variation from sibi or pro suo.
g 23.

Indtamentum. See n. Invitamentum is an easy correction if incito-
mentum be thought objectionable.
ς 31.

Homo causa eius modi. This is certainly unusual (see n.). In all
probability Cic. would not have written it had not pudore eo, ingemo
tanto, preceded, Vaustate amicorum: see n.
