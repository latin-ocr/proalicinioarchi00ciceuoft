JNTROD UCTJON. 9

Plautia Papiria), gave the citizenship to all individuah who
could prove, (1) that their names were on the burgess·roll of
some city in Italyl, whose relations with Rome were regulated
by a formal treaty (foedus, civitas foederata), (2) that they had
a settled habitation (domicilium) in Italy, (.3) that within sixty
days after the passing of the law they had inscribed their names
on the books of one of the praetors for the year2. Archias
claimed the citizenship under this law, possibly because his
title could thus be most clearly established, possibly also because
the Julian law had not been yet adopted by the Graeco-Italian
cities to which he belonged. He appeared before his intimate
friend Q. Metellus Pius³, one of the praetors of the year 89 B.C.,
who allowed his claim, on the grounds of his being a citizen of
Heraclia, and having a settled habitation at 'Rome. Archias
now took the full name of Aulus Licinius Archias. The name
Licinius was the name of the gens of which the Luculli formed
part, and Archias adopted it just as Roman slaves on being
freed adopted the gentile names of their old masters and new
patrons. Why he took the praenomen Aulus it is difficult to
say. If he had followed the usual custom‚ he would have as-
sumed a praenomen commonly used by the Luculli. But the
name Aulus never occurs as one of the names of a Lucullus.
This fact renders improbable the suggestion of some schoIars,
that the brother of Lucius Lucullus was originally called Aulus,
and not Marcus, which name he is supposed to have taken on
his adoption by M. Terentius Varro4.

Archias then was at Rome in 89 Β. C. In the years 86 and
70 Β. C.‚ we know him to have been absent with L. Lucullus on
his campaigns⁸. It is probable that he was attached to the
