52 PRO ARCHIA POETA. §17-

then ought we to honour Archias. ἓ 18. His seats both in improvised
and in studied poetry‚ have been marvellous, and shew inspiration.
Rightly did Ennius call poets “sacred’'. 5 19. I beg you to keep
as sacred the title of “poet''. Greek towns strove to prove after
Homer’s death that he was their citizen; shall we eject srom among us
Archias, while still alive? He has done great service to Rome, having
celebrated Marius, to whom he was dear. ξ 20. Even Marius loved
those who could record his achievements. ἓ 21. Archias has also
sung the mighty deeds of Lucullus, and has thus reflected a glory
on every Roman. §2²- So Ennius, who was beloved by Africanus
the elder, really glorified all Romans in glorifying the Marcelli and
others. Our forefathers made Ennius, an alien, a citizen; are we
to banish Archias? ἓ 23. Both nations and individual soldiers ought
to be glad to have their praises sung as widely as their conquests
extend. ἕ 24. Both Alexander and Pompey felt this. ς 25. Had
not Archias been already a citizen by laW, he would have received the
franchise from some commander. ἓ 26. Commanders are men and
greedy of fame. ἓ 27. This the examples of Brutus and Fulvius
shew.

ς ιτ.

2ο A ttingere .· “to touch lightly”, “dabble in''; cf. 28, l. 16 atlzgit versibus
atque incohavit, so attingere poeticen (Nep. Att. 18), a. strictim librum
(Att. 11 1, ι), extremis dzgitis a. (Pro Cael. 28).

21 Gustare.- lit. “to sip''‚ used like attingere for slightly occupying
oneself with a thing, dabbling in it. So De Nat. D. 1 20 primis, ut
dicitur, labris gustasse plzysz'olqgiam, In Pis. 58 non gustarat istam
tuam philosophiam, Plaut. Most. v 1 15 gustare eius sermonem, “to
get an inkling of his talk '' (by eavesdropping).

Etiam : this, as Halm observes, qualifies the whole clause, which
:etiam in aliis (i. e. non in nobis) videntes. It is possible, though not
so likely, that there is a mere ellipse of tum. (So Richter.) Cf.
Pro Flacco 9 etiam tum cum.

22 Tam animo agresti .- n. on 1, l. 1 quam sit exiguum.

23 Rosci: see Dict. Biog. He was famous for the summa venustas
(De Or. 1 130) or gracefulness of his acting.

Commoveretur: trans. “deeply affected”.

25 Omnino mori non .·⁴ observe the separation of om. from non by
mot-z.

Ergo ille etc.: observe the frequent use in this speech of this par·
ticular form of the rhetorical inference, where one sentence complete
in itself‚ and containing an admitted fact, i's followed by another con·
taining a question suggesting a negative answer. Cf. 19 (twice) 22, 3ο.
The two sentences are placed side by side (co-ordinated) without any
particle to connect them. It is usual to place between them a colon,
but the stop is a mere matter of taste, since the two sentences do
not in any sense coalesce to form one, but are merely in juxtaposition.
Sometimes the first of the two sentences, as well as the second, is in
