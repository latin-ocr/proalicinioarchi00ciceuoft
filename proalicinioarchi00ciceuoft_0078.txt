74 PRO ARCHIA POETA.

ς ¹2. Cottidie: ς ¹4 cottidianos. These forms have sar better
authority than either quotidie, quotidianus, or cotidie, cotidianus. The
spelling quotidie was probably first introduced by etymologizing grain·
marians5 cs. Quint. 1 7, 6, Corssen 1 175.

5 15. Inlustrem or illustrem? βο ἕ 16 impediunt or inpediunt?
5 ¹9 immanes or inmanes etc.? Latin usage varied so much that the

best uss are our only guides.

g 18. Quotiens not quoties, which has little authority. So totiens
(ἐ ²9)-

§ 19. Unquam or umquam? The change ‘of m to n before qu
seems to be later than Cic„ therefore umquam is the preferable ἴοι-ως

Corss. 1 262.

ξ 22. Sepulchro. The h is an intruder due to that popular tendency
to misplace aspirates which appears in the history os all languages. See
ᾒῖἒξῐὶὲῗ in Curtius’ Studien 11 145. The form is thoroughly well

ἓ 22. Caelum not coelum, which is absolutely destitute of authority,
and arises from the delusion that the Latin word is a mere transcription
of the Greek κοῖλον.

g 24. Mitylenaeum. The name of the town is found in both forms,
Ξὶὅὲἓήνη and Μυτιλήνη, so Latin MSS sometimes give May, sometimes

g 27. Atti. The name of this poet is often written Accius ; 1 know
of no means whereby the right form may be determined.

§28- Incohavit. This seems the best spelling of this singular
word; cf. Roscher in Curtius' Studien 11 148. The root seems cav-
from which carne an old adjective co-us for covus, another form of cavus.
Through vulgar aspiration the lz sprang up between the vowels ; hence
incohare, literally “to make a hollow in a thing '’.

11. Variations in the Text other than orthographical.

There is no existing MS of a Classical author which does not
contain numerous errors. The consideration of these errors and of
the corrections which scholars have proposed, is instructive to the
student who wishes to get an accurate knowledge of the Latin language.
Instead of enumerating in succession as they occur in the speech such
errors and corrections as our present purpose requires us to notice,
1 will classify them in groups, in the hope of rendering these textual
discussions less distastesul than they are commonly felt to be by
younger students‚ in England at least. The reasons for preferring
one reading to another are often contained in the notes already given.
When that is the case they will not be repeated here. Thte variants
are taken from Baiter’s recension in Baiter and Halm's edition ofv
