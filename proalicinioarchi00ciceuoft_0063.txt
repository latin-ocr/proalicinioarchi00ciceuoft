ΝοΤΕε. 59

26 Legibus .·=“ legaJ1y”‚ as α 5, 1. 15, ¹9, 1. αι, Terence Phorm. lv 3, ἰι
leg-ibus daturum poenas, and often. Only one law was applicable to the
case of Archias, vir. that of Silvanus and Carbo.

Constaezutum: “settled’'‚ “ established ”,· as Velleius n 3² relliquiae
”raedonum in certa sede constituit.

De: after eicere more usually e, as De Or. 111 11 eiectus est e civitate,
but cf. Ad Qu. Fr. 11 5, α Flaccum de collaeio caecarunt.

ἕ 23.

²7 Nam: often· used in Cic. elliptically to introduce an answentoa
{1333523553033333553333333?ss 51:332& ”ssssffffssssip‘m'ssff
tioned FLflthe reason is that—'’). This use is far commonet in Cic.

than in other writers3 for nam in this use is found enim rarcly, namque
never.

29 Leguntur in gentibus .· so De Leg- 11 i 3 quae sciscuntur in populis.
30 Suis finibus .· at this time Latin had hardly begun (except in Gallia

Cisalpina) to supersede the language of the conquered countrieg andwas
spoken only in Latium and the Latin and Roman colonies.

Exigua} sane: “ small, you must admit ''-

Continentur: although continere may be followed by the abl. with or

without in, the passive and se continere are always followed by the
simple ablative.

3¹ Definiuntur:=finiuntur; common in Cic„ as Orat. 65 similiter
extrema definiunt. So definitus is often the opposite of infinitus. The
present tense should be noticed. The reference is doubtless to the great
conquests in the East achieved by Lucullus and Pompey, then scarcely
concluded. Cf. Pro Balb. 64 C . Caesar in eis· est nunc locis quae regione
orbem terrarum, rebus illius gestis imperium populi Romani definiunt,
Pro Sest. 67. For the sense of reffio=“geographical division'’ cf. In

Cat. 1v 2 1 Pompeius, cuius res gestae tls-dem quibus solis cursus regionibus
ac terminis continentur; cf. ib. 111 26. See also 29, 1. 23.

P. 30.

ι Ampla : “ honourable” ; the dat. with amplum is common in Livy,

as 11 9, 4 Porsinna cum regem esse Romae tum Etruscae gentis regem
amplum Tuscis ratus.

2 De vita dimicant: so Pro Sest. 1 1 de capite dinnkare, περὶ ψυχΐίς
ἀγωνίζεσθαι. So 29, 1. 26.

3 Incitamentum: not found elsewhere in prae-Augustan or Augusta,
though common in silver Latin. 1 think the word is genuine here, '
though if Cic. wrote invitamentum (a favourite word of his) the change

in the uss would be easy. Another similar word, iter-affimativa, though
found in Sallust and Ovid, does not occur in Cic.

Et laborum .· notice the oonocation of the words in this clause.
