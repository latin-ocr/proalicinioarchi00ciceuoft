PREFACE.

TEACHERS in Germany and in England have recently

purpose I have kept in view is the training of the
student's eye to detect not only the more obvious but
the slighter and finer matters of scholarship. The
selection of points for comment by editors of Classical
texts naturally depends a good deal on individual
taste3 what one scholar thinks important another will
not notice. I tru'st that at least a brief note has been
given in the present edition to every point in language
and subject-matter which any practised scholar would
be likely to deem worthy of remark. Particular pains
have been taken to point out the special characteristics
