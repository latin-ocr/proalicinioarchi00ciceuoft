of Greece during'the period of their political freedom. The
Senate, as chief executive authority, occasionally sor reasons of
state directed the magistrates to expel from Rome certain
classes of foreign residents. In this way the Greek philosophers
and rhetoricians were ejected in 161 B-c.1 But the only statute
passed before the Lex Papia which had the same purport, was
one carried by a tribune, M. Iunius Pennus, in 126 Β. C.‚ which
forbade aliens to settle in Rome ². Both measures were prompted
rather by passing considerations of political expediency than by
actual hatred of aliens. Pennus wished to clear Rome of the
Italians who flocked there in the hope of benefiting by the
policy of the party led by the Gracchi³. So Papius desired to
remove from the capital the foreign portion of the rabble which
held possession of the streets and the forum under the leader-
ship of Catiline and his friends, and was fast making orderly
government impossible. The law of Papius was really one
result of a great movement against electoral corruption, which
produced the numerous laws against ambitus that were passed
towards the close of the Republican period.

The prosecutor was one Gratius, a man entirely unknown
excepting from Cicero’s s'peech. The work of prosecution was
considered at Rome too invidious for men of distinction⁴. The
defendant evidently did not take the case seriously. L. Lucullus
and his other powerful friends might have procured for him the
services of all the most eminent counsel. In the similar case of
Balbus, Cicero, Pompeius and Crassus all appeared for the de-
fence. In this case Cicero alone was retained. His acceptance
of the-brief was intended as a public indication of his adhesion to
