The copyist of G, having had to write quotz'ens ego twice over
in 5 18, inserts ego after quotiens when it occurs for the third time. So
G E in 5 23 after writing quo are misled into adding minus, owing
to its similarity to the succeeding word manuum. In E after tamen
in 5 25, non is added. Negatives are inserted and omitted with
extraordinary frequency in the MSS of Cic. In 5 11 ita before seiam
tum seems to have arisen from the mistake of writing sit aster cemus
as well as before. Examples of syllables added owing to a partial
doubling, are deduxm·t for duxm't (G E in 5 2 5), habitatu for habitu
‹Gfinl§ 15), agitatur for agutur (S in 5 3, where Stuerenburg’s defence
is uti e .

The) single letter t is added by E which gives Archita sor Archia
in the title of the speech and in 5 18 (cf. censitam given bydthe editio
Ascensiana of 1511 in5 11 sor censam, or rather for censeam, which
all Baiter and Halm's authorities have). The MSS have Gratti sor
Grati in 5 12, for which GEP have Gratis in 5 8.. [Proper names
get terribly mangled in the MSS. Thus 5 7 Sillani or Silam· for
Silvani, in 5 16 Affricanum sor Africanum (so 5 22), 5 19 Smirnii
sor Smyrnaei, 5 ἰο Clodium for Plotium, 5 22 rudem tum, tu, or
tamen sor Rudinum, 5 27 etiolis emio for Aetolis Ennio, 5 ²4 illi ars
for IliasJ. Other cxx. of inserted letters are nec for ne (P in 5 2,
GE in 5 11), whereby the un·Ciceronian nec-quidem is introduced,
retcz'etur, sor which 1 write cicietur in 5 10, accenderet for accederet (E in
ἓ 14, see n. on the passage), ergo for ego (G E in 5 153 this change i's
31er cogn-mog), orat? for 1⁴{attio (P in 5 1·5)t. A Qrifusquffimffigj insertion

c. verb-forms confused.

This class of corruptions is exceedingly common, and requires
cautious treatment by editors. Several of the communest corruptions
of this class are represented in the MSS of the Pro Archia. (1) Impers.
indic. act. of 1st conjugation confused with present: 5 4 celebrantur
for celebrabantur in Ε. Stuerenburg and others vainly defend the
present as a historical present. The whole syntax of the sentence
would then be un·Ciceronian. (2) Fut. ind. of rst conj. confused
with pres. ι repudiamus for repudiabimus in 5 19. The pres, is quite
out of place, as the event is one which Cic. would only contemplate
hypothetically in the future. (3) Pres. subj. of lst and and conj.
confused with pres. ind.: 5 8 desideres for desideras in P; also 5 10
dubitatis for dubitetis in G E, ἓ 18 videntur for videantur in E.
(4) Pluperf. ind. of 3rd conj. confused with fut. perf. ind. or perf.
subj.: 5 ²4 inveneras for inveneris in GEP. (5) Pers. ind. of 2nd
:if'sskh“zftffissdpfflr.{{;⁵}3;g2ss1 {⁶3⁵ 132³? &⁰³05 ’ζίἒῖῗοὲῖ 2³05:
fused with fut. ind.: 5 ἠ eiciamus for ezcz'emus in G. It is often pe-
cuIiarly difficult to choose between these forms. Eiciamus might
very well stand here3 cf. 5 19 moveamur in a very similar sentence.
7) Singular confused with plural: 5 23 continet in E sor continentur.
8) Passive confused with active: 5 23 the passage just quoted, and
ξ 25 donaret in E for donaretur.
