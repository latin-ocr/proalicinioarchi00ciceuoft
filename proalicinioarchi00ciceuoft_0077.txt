- 5 ’5. Vehementius: this form is earlier in Latin literature than
vementius, and was probably used by Cic., though our MSS osten give
the latter. Neglegebantur and § 9 neglegentius, ἕ 1 7 neglegemus are right
(and sound in some good MSS of this speech) not negligebantur etc.,
so intellego not intellzgoe see Fleckeisen p. 19. Regini, here and ἓ 10
is the spelling of the best MSS which is amply confirmed by inscrip-
tions, which shew Regium not Rhegium ; Fleckeisen p. 25. AIaximas:
one good MS gives maxumas here and proxumis in ἓ 1 1. Usage varied
and whether i or u was written the sound was one which lay between i
and u and coincided with neither (Corssen 1 331). Adulescentiae, and
ξ 19 adulescens. These forms have far more authority than adolescentia

etc. 3 Corssen 11 138.

§8- Heracliae, Heracliensem ,· so the MSS throughout the speech,
not Heracleae. The termination -εια in the names of Greek towns is
more often represented by ῖα in Latin than by ἔα. ’

ἓ 9. Optinent: this spelling is so often given by good MSS (one has
it here) and inscriptionS‚ and is so likely to have been altered by late
scribes, that I adopt it.

ἕ ιο, Scaenzcis: the true form, not scenicae (Corssen 1 325)· Pro·
bably Lat. ae was nearer in sound than Lat. ἔ to the sound of η. Ezcz'etur,
eicimms (§ 22) not eice-tetur etc.; so adicio, dbicz‘o, clinici& Munro on
Lucr. 1 34. The ἄ of iacio sinks to (vowel) ἴ, the i (consonantal = y)
falls out in the compound‚ and the preceding syllable is generally
lengthened in compensation‚ if not long already. One of the best MSS
has eiciemus in ἓ 22. Baiter curiously writes eiiciemus there but reicistur
here.

5 12. Convicio ,· with this take otium (ἕ 3), solacium (ξ 16), contio
(ἓ 24 where one of the best MSS has t not c), condicio (§ 25). All these
words are spelled in MSS sometimes with c sometimes with t. In the
age of Cic. and for centuries after ci (ki) was sounded very differently
from ti, but the writers of our MSS sounded them very much alike and
capriciously substituted one form sor the other. Thus some of the best
MSS of the Pro Archia write in ἓ 10 Gratia instead of Graecia, and
imperciebant for impertiebant. The spellings concio, ocium, conditio also
datis, solatium (see Fleckeisen) are now all but universally admitted to
have no warrant, though Bait. and Halm osten still write conditio (as in
ἓ 2 5) in obedience to the MSS. The word convicium presents difficulty,
as does suspicio. While the bulk of MSS authority is in favour of
convitium, some of the most ancient and precious give convicium, which
also finds support in utterances os the grammarians. Much the same
may be said of suspicio. It is admitted that if convitium, suspitio be true
forms they must have come from the roots vah, spak, through the forms
convic-itium, suspic-itio or suspectio. But in that case it is impossible, in
accordance with the phonetic laws of Latin, to account sor the disap-
pearance of the c. Suspicio, convicium must therefore be adopted. See
the evidence in Corssen’s Beitrage p. 15 sq. and F leckeisen‘s F iinszig
