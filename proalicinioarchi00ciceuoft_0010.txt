attributed to an Archias who may have been our Archias, but
the name (of Doric origin) was so common among the Greeks
that we cannot feel certain. No fragments of the longer poems
we know Archias to have written have come down to our time.
About the year 103 13.C., Archias, still only a boy, lest home
sor a long course os travel. The political troubles that disturbed
his native land had no doubt clouded the prospects of men of
genius¹. He first visited the cities of Western Asia, then tra-
versed Greece, passed over to the Greek towns of Southern
Italy, and finally reached Rome in 102 B.C. If Cicero is to be
believed, the journey of Archias was throughout a sort of tri-
umphal progress : his visits were expected everywhere with the
utmost eagerneSS, and welcomed with the greatest enthusiasm.
If his talents had been admired in Greece proper, it was natural
that they should be still more highly valued in the cities of
Magna Graecia, which had a strong Italian element in their
population, and were therefore both by nature and by habit fond
of improvisation ². The intellectual activity also of the Graeco-
Italian cities (which forty years later had died away3) made
foreign men of letters sure of a warm reception there. The citi-
zens of Tarentum, Regium, Neapolis, and possibly Locri⁴, pre-

Rome, which he reached at an opportune time. The domestic
peace of Rome and Latium had been long unbroken, and art
and science flourished vigorously, more vigorously than at the
time when this speech of Cicero was delivered, after forty years
of almost constant political troubles. The great impulse given
to Greek culture by the circle of litterati of which the house of
the Scipios formed the centre, had not yet died away⁵. The ,
patronage of learning and genius, and especially of Greek learn-
ing and genius, was a fashion. of the day with the aristocratic
