NOTES. ⁴7

tidiano actu sorensi ingenia optime rerum talium blanditia rma-aunt,
ideoqzae in leac latione Cicero requiescendum putat.
²4 Tantam posse contentionem .- observe the order of the words.
26 His studiis .·= 1, l. 4 optimarum artium studiis.
Deditum .· a strong word3 “devoted ”3 so in α, 1. ¹9·

Pudeat.- n. on r, l. 5 confiteor.

²⁷ , Litteris: elsewhere Cic. nearly always makes abdo take an accu-
sative, either with or without in. Thus Ad Fam. vn 33, α melotam in
litteras abdere; In Pis. 93. With a perfect or plupersect tense, and
with the passive participle, since the motion is contemplated as finished
and the rest begun‚ an ablative sometimes follows, but always with in.
If in the present passage litter-125 is an abl. of place, the omission os in is
without parallel in Cic. or any other prose writer before Tacitus. lt
has been taken as an ablative os the instrument as in Fam. lx ao, 3
involvo me litter-121· (if the reading be right). But who would speak of
using literature as an instrument or means for hiding ἓ Others construe
litten's here as a dative; cf. Verg. Aen. 11 5 5 3 lateri capulo tenus abdidit
ffiffieffi‘t’. Ἐγὴεῖῗιξιεὴέοἷῗέἷέὲἱιέἔὲξιῖιιὲοξῖῡςιῗξιῖεὸῑῖῐ ζἰῗᾱαῑὸιᾰῖεάέἕέ
probable that in has dropped out before latter-135 m the uss.; cf. n. on
7,1. 27, also on 2,1. 25.

Mhil...·.neque...neque note the negatives after niba, where in Eng.
we should use positive expressions.

²9 Ita vivo etc.: Cic. osten makes this boast, as in 11 Phil. 20.

30 Tempore: here= “ hour of peril,'’ referring to criminal mss, while
commodo refers to private law-suits. Cf. Pro imp. Cn. IJotnp. x amiso·
rum temporibus with Arch. 13, p. 26 1. 8 anneot-um penculn, In Vat. a
pervento—tempori.

· ‘35 Raardanz: ronow-ed bya Ad Fam. v 17, ι. Remark the artistic
construction of the last clause.
