The PaQfflmRnanQmemflu-

ence an orator could arouse in favour of his client, and m Cicero
the grea majority o t e apparently irrelevant digressions are
due to this causel.

But there is another consideration which must not be over-
looked. We have not before us the speech as Cicero spoke it,
but only a version of it revised and corrected for publication in
later years. It was our orator's practice in the less important
caseS, before delivering a speech, to elaborate with great care
the exordium and the peroration‚ which were almost committed
to mernory, while for the facts and arguments he trusted to rough
notes, to be filled out by extempore speaking. In editing his
speeches for publication he left out much of the direct argument
as of no permanent interest, while he elaborated and expanded
his treatment of the more general topics. The case of Archias
was in some respects exceptional. The facts were clear and
simple, and gave little scope for subtle argument or rhetorical
display. If the speech was to be of any interest to posterity‚
it could only be by the excellence of Cicerq’s handling of the
extraneous matter.

Lord Brougham has said in a passage already quoted, that
the speech is “exquisitely composed.'’ Not a few scholars in
Germany have held a different opinion. It has been alleged
that the language is turgid and declamatory‚ and it has been
concluded that the speech is therefore not from the hand of
Cicero. But there is no speech of Cicero which does not ex-
hibit passages that to a modern taste seem excessively rhe-
torical. If there is more rhetoric in this speech than in most
others of Cicero, we have already seen reasons which make this
natural. But after all, much that seems to us mere declamation
appeared to the ancients tasteful eloquence. The most turgid
