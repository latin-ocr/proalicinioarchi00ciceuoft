“It is an admirable specimen of oeresul editing. An introduction tells us everything
we could wish to know about Archias, about Cicero’s connexion with him, about the
merits of the trial, and the genuineness of the speech. 'l'he text is well and oeresully
printed. The notes are clear and scholar-like. No boy ωτι master this little volume
without feeling that he has advanced a long step in scholarship.”—Academy.

“The best of them, to our mind. are Mr Reid's two volumes containin the Pro
Archia Poeta and Pro Balbo of Cicero. The introductions, which deal with t e circum·
siances os each speech, giving also an analysis of its contenis and a criticism of its merim,
are madeus of clear and concise statement, at once intelligible to junior students and
useful for those who are more advanced.''—Guardian.

“Mr Reid has previously edited the De Amicitia and the speeches Pro

“As the Cato Major is one of the most popular of its author's works, it
is fortunate that it should be included in the series of an interpreter who
has done so much to advance an intelligent and critical knowledge of
Latinity in this country.”—Atl1enaeum.

ORATIO. Edited for Schools and Colleges. Extra sep. 15.6d. ¹

'‘Mr Reid's orations sor Archias and sor Balbus profess to keep in mind the training
of the student’s eye for the finer and more delicate matters of scholarship no less than
sor the niore obvious: and not only deal with the commonplace notabilia os a Latin
oration as they serve the needs of a commonplace student, but also point out the
specialities of Cicero's subject-matter and modes of expression. . . . We are bound to
recognize the pains devoted in the annotation of these two orations to the minute and
thorough study os their Latinity, both in the ordinary notes and in the textual
appendices.''—Saturday Review.

“Mr Reid's Pro Balbo is marked by the same qualities as his edition of the Pro

. A rclzia.’'— The Academy.
