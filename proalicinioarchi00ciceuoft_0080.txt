76 PRO ARCHIA POETA.

verb esse is seldom or never left out by Cic. 1 also write est after
virtutis in ἕ ⁶, see p. 78. ν

Single letters also are frequently neglected by the transcnbers of
the mss. 'rhusg 1 si qua sor si quae (note that the following word
begins with e); so ins* 31 and in ἕ 32 E has qua sor quae, ΕΡ qm·
for quid at beginning of ξ 26. T has fallen out in ἐ 21 where GEP
have naturae regione for natura et regybrte (this restoration by Mommsen
is better than natura regy'onzls· which Baiter gives); cf. praetexatus
iu E for praetextatus (ξ 5), and see my remarks on the reading gra·
tuito gravat in ἕ ιο, below· M and n are often dropped ς so ἓ 28
nulla for nullam in G E ; ξ 9 Gabii sor Gabini in P. R. was written as an
abbreviation for Roma‘ni ; so G misses out that word altogether in ξ 3¹·

A specimen of mere carelessness is the omission of petimus by G

in 5 3¹ 5 also petere in E (ἕ 1) for rqpetere.

“atbar words, syllables, and letters inserted by uss and omitted by
ι.

One of the most frequent sources of corruption was the practice
of writing words on the margin. If the transcribet missed out a word
and found out the omission, he frequently wrote in the margin the
omitted word. But the margin also frequently contained explanatam
(glosses) on difficult words in the text; sometimes also mere reflexions
on passages in the text made by the transcriber or his predecessors:
Sometimes a transcribet finding these glosses or comments on the
margin, fancied that they belonged to the text, and had been written
at the side because his predecessor had missed them out. So he in·
serted them in the text. A good instance of a gloss is found in
ς 20 where quod acroama is followed by qualia carmina in E 3 evidently
originally an explanation written at the side. In ἓ 10 we have a
singular string of mistakes. On the words civitatem in Graecia im·
patiebant, some scribe wrote the marginal comment gratuito, meaning
that the citizenship was conferred for no particular reason, without
justification. This word crept into the text. Then the first t ofgratuito
was dropped, cf. exx. of t omitted above, and the scribes turned the
word into gravat. Later scribes finding gratuito in some MSS, wrote
at the side or between the lines uel gratuita, or gratuito merely, meaning
‘⁶ or the reading may be gratuito ”. The remark vel gratuito is found
over the line in G, but is introduced into the text in E, which reads
vel gratuito gravat. There are scores of passages in the MSS ot
Cic. where the word uel introduces a variant which has wrongly
found its way into the text. P has gratuito gravat without vel.
Stuerenburg rightly rejected the words altogether. A still further
corruption is due to this word gratuito. In E after noluisse at the
end of the sentence the words sed credendum est are oddly introduced.
In some copy aster the word gratuito the words sed credendum est

were written on the margin. The whole comment then meant, “they ’

gave the citizenship for no particular reason, but still we must believe
they did so ’'. The words sed credendum est being a little displaced

came opposite noluisse, when the copyist of E or one of his predecessors
inserted them in the text.
