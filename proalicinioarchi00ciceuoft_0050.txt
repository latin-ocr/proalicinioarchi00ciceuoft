46 PRO ARCHIA PO'ETA. ξω.

him as a citizen. The word beneficium is much used in connexion with
patronage. Thus so long as the military tribuneships remained in the
gift of the consuls, they were called beneficia consulum (Livy IX 3o);
after that they became populi Romani beneficia (Verr. v 180, Sallust
Iugurtha XXXI). The phrase deferre in aerarium (Pro Balbo 63 Caesar
praesectum fabrum detulit) is especially used of the beneficia, while re-
ferre in aer. is used of money and accounts. The two phrases come
together in Ad Fam. v 20, 6 and 7. In Pro Sest. 54 the beneficia are

mentioned as having been settled by Gabinius bcybre he went into his
province; cf. 11 Phil. 82.

17 ,Neque suo etc.: will never be resuted by an appeal to the judgments
he has passed on himself (ipsius iudicio l. 12) or which have been
passed on him by his friends, i. e. he and his friends have always acted
as though he were really citizen. The verb revincere (found here only
in Cic.) is a legal term, like refutare, redarguere, refellere, and in prose

writers is used generally with legal reference, as Liv. VI 26, 7 crimina
revicta ‚· Tac. Ann. xv 73 revicta coniuratio.

ἐξ 12—14. Reasons for talnng interest in Archias. summat-y.
ἓ 12. A man like Archias provides us with relaxation for our minus,
without which we advocates could not support our labours. Ι am not
asharned to confess myself a student of literature, for which, however,
I have never neglected my profession. ἓ 13. Ι surely may be allowed
to spend on literature such time as others spend on idle amusements‚
and the rnore so because literature nourishes oratory. g 14. The high-
est moral ideas are conveyed by literature, which also preserves for us
pictures of the great men of the past who ought to be our models.

g 12.

19 Tanto ppere .· to be written thus, not tantopere ‚· so magno, maximo,
summo, nimio opere.

20 Suppeditat ubi .· note the omission of an antecedent for ubi, which is
caused by the difficulty of finding a noun suited to a person: the natural
word locum is inapplicable.

21 Ex .- here = ‘ after ’, of time.

Con-vic-io .· (connected with vox) denotes literally a din of many
voices together. Cic. and the older Latin writers rarely use the word
of the noise made by a single voice. In passages like Aoed. 11 34
(convicio veritatis), Ad Fam. xv 18, 1 (convicium Platonis), there is pre·
sent an idea of the repetition of sounds by a single voice. In older

Latin the plural is rare; Cic. uses it but thrice (Ad Att. 11 18, 1,
De Nat. D. 11 20, De Fin. 1 69).

Μ Tu: observe the emphasis; nobis=0ratmbus.

Suppetere: here used as the passive of suppeditare. Quint. Χ, 1, 27
alludes to this passage: Plurimum ‹lu-22¹ oratori conferre mophrastus

' lectionem poetarum multique eius iudicium sequuntur, nec immerito.
