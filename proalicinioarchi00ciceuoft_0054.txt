50 PRO ARCHIA POETA. §15-

²4 Cogi‘tatzone hominum: :de hominibus; so often, as Sest. 11 praeteriti
temporis cogitationen& in Eng.‘ ‘the thought of'’.

ἓξ 15, ¹6. Answer to supposed objections. Summary. It will be
objected, were the great men of antiquity acquainted with literature and
philosophy? Ι answer, that natural excellence alone has made many
men great without culture. But the union of natural excellence with
culture is necessary sor producing the greatest characters. The atten-
tion paid to literature by Cato the censor shews its value.

g 15.

26 Quaeret quispiam. ’ commonly used, like dicet aliquit, to introduce
an anticipated or imaginary objection-

27 Litteris: probably the abl. of the instrument as Verr. Act. 11 1 47
proditum est memoria ac litteris (as the best edd. read); yet memoriae
prodere 1s common.

29 Confirmare: “to state positively’'; ἰσχυρίζεσθαι.

Est certum qssuzd “1 am clear about the answer Ι must give’'.
After certum est the infinitive usually follows3 but cf. Verr. v 53 qui

comedy phrases like certa res est ut abeam, certum est quid agam etc.

33 Ad laudem valuisse : “has availed to produce excellence’'; the same
constr. is in De Or. 111 104. The use of ad is like that in 4 1. 21 aa
humanitatem informari, where see n.

P..2·1

1 Idem ego: “1 further maintain” ;different from egv etiam (e. g.
Terence, Hec. v 1, 36) which would mean “I as well as others'’. Cf.

training and the cultivation afforded by learning''. For quaedam see
n. on 2, l. 21, · for conformatio cf. 1, 1. 14 conformata.

4 lVescio quid: “ ‘a certain product which is noble and precious‘fl
Singulare‚ properly=“ unique’ ’‚ is here a rhetorical exaggeraston, and
nescio quid marks the fact that the orator is not quite satisfied with

his choice of epithets. ἓ 16

Exhocnumero: n. 01131 1. 25.

5 Hunc: points out Africanus the younger, as being nearer in time
to the speaker than A. the elder; so De Or.11 ω, ”o Africanum hunc
Aemilianum, De Rep.1 14 Africanus hic Paulli filius.1n Verr.
V 25 the two Africani are mentioned together, the younger being in-
dicated by hic, the elder by zlle.

Divinum:=‘ ‘glorious” ‚ simply.
