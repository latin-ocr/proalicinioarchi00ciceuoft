INTRODUCTION. 19

passage in this speech has been quoted no sewer than six times
by Quintilian, and often with expressions of approvaP.

Another ground on which scholars have attacked the authen-
ticity of the speech is, that it contains a few ἅπαξ εῖρημένιι, and
words which do not elsewhere occur in Cicero. The force of
such criticisrns 1 shall examine elsewhere ². I will only say
here, that any one who has examined long and minutely Cicero’s
syntax, his collocations of words, his balancing of clauses, and
his characteristic changes of expression, will refuse to believe
that any mere imitator, were it Erasmus himself, could have
produced any thing so Ciceronian as the speech Pro Archia. I
myself have never seen a piece of writing of any length by
a modern scholar, professing to be Ciceronian, whose lang-uage
would not betray its origin. There are few of the best Latinists
at Oxsord and Cambridge who could be trusted to write a
page of faultlessly Ciceronian Latin; 1 doubt if there is one who
could compose a piece so long as the Pro Archia without pass-
ing over some convicting flaws. What is nearly impossible for
the best of modern Latinists‚ must have been quite impossible
sor a Roman of the first century of the Empire.
