CICERO’S client Archias was a Greek, born about the year
119 B.C.¹‚ at Antioch, the chief city of Syria. His family held
’ high rank, and in the schools of Antioch, which was at that
time a home of learning and culture, he received a liberal edu-

cation2.- In those days, both in Greek and in Roman communi-
ties, the study of poetry formed the most important part of edu-

cation. Like Pope, Archias seems when a child to have “lisped
in numbers,'’ and his natural cleverness was so cultivated that
before he had arrived at manhood his fame as a poet was widely
known beyond the bounds of his native city. He was especially
skilful as an improvisatore³‚ and ranked with the famous Anti-
pater of Sidon4, who, as Cicero tells us, could pour forth verses
in any metre on any subject at a moment's notice-⁸³. The written

poems of Archias were thought by his contemporaries worthy to
be placed side by side with the works of the old Greek Classic
poets ⁶. Some poor epigrams in the Greek Anthology⁷ are
