'⁸ Mr Reid has decidedly attained his aim. namely. ‘a thorough examination of the
Latinity os the dialogue.' . . The revision o( the text is most valuable, and-comprehendo
sundry acute corrections, . . . This volume, like Mr Reid's other editions, is a solid gam

to the scholarship os the country.’‘—At{1erqaeum. . ⁵ ι
“A more distinct gain to scholarship is Mr Reid’s able and thorough edition os the

De Amicitia of Cicero, a work os which, whether we regan-d the exhaustive introduction
or the instructive and most suggestive commentam, it would be difficult to s ak too
highly . . . . When we come to the commentary, we are only amazed by its ulness in
proportion to its bulk. Nothing is overlooked which mn tend to enlarge the learner’s

“Mr Reid is so well known to scholars as a commentator on Cicero ¹that: va nev
work from him scarcely needs any commendation of ours. His edition of the speech Bm
Sulla is sully equal in merit to the volumes which he has already published . .’. . lt
would be difficult to speak too highly of the notes. There could be no better way ot'
gaining an insight into the characteristics of Cicero’s style and the Latinity os his period
than by making a caresul study of this speech with the aid of Mr Reid's commentary . . .
Mr Reid's intimate knowledge os the minutest details of scholarship enables him to detect
and explain the slightest points of distinction between the usages of different authors and
different periods . . . . The notes are followed by a valuable appendix on the text, and

“ MryReid's wide and prosound knowledge of his author’s diction renders him a
particularly sure guide to his meaning, and no intelligent student cau read one of his
works without a material strengthening of his scholarship . . . . Itis not too much to say
that the style of Mr Reid's commentaries is now approachin'g· perfection.”—-·A thenaeum.

“There is plenty of help for the t1'ro,· but there are few indeed among advaneed
Ciceronian scholars who will not feel that there is many a crumb sor them, too, mtered
here and there in his instructive notes. The confidence with which cicero’s usa e is
laid down, even upon comparatively trifling points, is warranted by the store o apt
references always ready to bear out the mle . . . . On the whole it is impossible to
desire a book more completely τετράγωνος, ἄνευ ψόγου τεπιγμένος.”-Αεαᾰεηι].
