1 Varietate terra marique: Cic. of Lucullus in Acad. 11 3 tantus impe·
rator in omni genere belli suit, proeliis· oppugnationibus, navalibus pugnis.
α Totum: as Richter says2 this is most likely incorrect ; Archias

would not sing the praises of Pompey who finished the war, but merely
those of Lucullus.

Expressum est: “was treated’'; see n. on 30, p. 32, 1. 6.

7 Non maxima manu .· Tigranes the Armenian king on seeing the
army of Lucullus, said (Plut. Luc. 27) εἰ μὲν ὡς πρεσβευταὶ, πολλοὶ
πάρεισιν, εἰ δὲ ὡς στρατιῶται ὀλίγοι. According to Plutarch, Lucullus

had only 10,ooo men against an army composed of 20‚ooo bowmen and
slingers, 5o‚000 horse, 100,ooo hoplites, and 3o,000 others.

9 Cyzicenorum .· Cic. does not mention the events in the order of their
occurrence. Cf. Pro Mur. 33 (the whole of which section should be
closely compared with our passage) fidelissimorum sociorum Cyzicenorum.

ιο Ore ac saucibus .· war is almost personified here3 so πολέμοιο στόμα,

Apud Tenedum .· the great battle Cic. means was really fought (Β. c.

os Tenedos. So Plutarch Luc. c. 3 πρὸς Τενέδῳ. &ss
