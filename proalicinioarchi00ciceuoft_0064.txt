60 PRO ARCHIA POETA. §24

ἐκ.

5 Sigeo: a mountainous district on the N. W. of the Troad, abutting
on the sea and forming one side of the entrance to the Hellespont.
Here tradition placed the graves of several heroes of the Iliad, Achilles,
Patroclus, Antilochus, Ajax. Cf. Fam. V 12, 7 praeconium quodcum
in Sigeum venisset Alexander ab Homero Achilli tributum esse dixit.

Achilli: see A ppendix B p. 71.
7 Et vere: sc. dim'z‘, so that the clause is in form similar to the

emphatic repeating clause in passages like Verr. 111 152 tenetur et
manifesto tenetur, v 121 errabas, Verres, et vehementer errabas.

8 Contexerat: i. e. priusquam Ilias illa exstiterat.

Noster hic magnus: opposed to Alexander ille magnus. No doubt

10 Cum virtute fortunam: Pro Balbo 9 in quo uno (Pompeio) ita
summa fhrtuna cum summa virtute certavit ut onmium iudicio plus
homini quam deae tribueretur.

1 1 Contione .· notice that this term is also used for a meeting of citizens
at Rome under the presidency of a magistrate acting in his civil
capacity. In early times at Rome little distinction was drawn between
meetings for military and meetings for civil purposes; thus the term
exercitus was applied to the comitia centuriata. In serm, and in
theory, the citizens assembled in the military contio conferred the
citizenship on a stranger by the same right which they would have
exercised had they been assembled sor the same purpose in the comitia
centuriata ; in practice the citizenship was the gift of the general, and
the military contio was often not even called together (see Pro Balbo
19). The gift seems to have been very common, and the general
mnnot always have acted under a law empowering him to grant it,
as Pompey did on one occasion (Pro Balbo 19). Praetically, the grant
seems to have been valid in each individual case until successfully
called in question by a prosecutor in a court of law (Pro Balbo 48).

13 Eiusdem laudis .· sc. qua Theophanes Pompeium cumulaverat.

17 Hispanos et Gallos: one Greek of Massilia and one citizen of Gades ’

are mentioned Pro Balbo 50. ·

19 De populo: εἷς τῶν πολλῶν, and so a bad poet. Cf. Brut. 13¹
accusator de plebe, Div. in Caec. 50 de populo subscriptor, Brut. 274
qui non ficit orator unus e multis. De thus used to express the severance
of a part from a whole ultimately drove out the partitive genitive when
Latin passed into the Romance languages. In Cic. the use is commonest
after such words as unus, solus, aliquis, nemo, nullus, nihil, nonnulli,
numerals and superlative adjectives <Draeger 1 585).
