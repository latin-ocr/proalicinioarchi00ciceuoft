e. various forms. Ei, ii, eis, iis. Such high authorities as Ritschl
and Fleckeisen totally reject the forms ii, iis. It is extremely probable,
that Cic. wrote ei, eis, possibly even ῖς. On the whole it is safest to
read ei, eis. So eisdem or isdem should be written, not iisdem—Sapien-
tium, excellentium (ξ 14). Authority is against the forms in -um ; see
Neue, 11 80 sq. ed. 2. Honos (ἓ 22) is right in the text of Cic. (as in
that os Livy) not honam see Neue 1 169, ed. 2.—Si quae (fem. sing. in
ἕ ι, neut. plur. in ς 11). The passages in the good MSS of Cic. where
si quae occurs are on the whole more numerous than those which shew
si quii ‚· when therefore we consider the temptation under which late
copyists laboured to alter the rarer into the commonet form, it is clear
that by writing si quaein any particular passage we are more likely
to be right than wrong. Two of the best MSS have si quae in§ 11.—

g 1. Ceteris. This form is alone right. The form caetm‘s has no
authority whatever, and sprang out os the once prevalent delusion that
ceteri was borrowed from the Greek καὶ ἕτεροι. See Fleckeisen, Fiinfzig

No deelslon can be given from MSS readings which vary continually.
But a wellknown passage in Cic. Orator 153 seems to me to shew
concluswelynthat Cic. wrote paulo—“quomodo enim vester Axilla Ala
sactus est, mstfuga litterae vas-tiens? quam litteram etiam e maxillis et
ve3nllo et pauxillo consuetudo elegans Latini sermonis evellit.” Cic.
evidently assumes that the four words Axilla, maxilla, vem‘llum, pauxil-
lum, correspond to the sour Ala, mala, velum, paulum—The form aput

is given by many MSS and was probably employed by Cic. when the
succeedmg word began with a tenuis, or s.

5 4. Athen-cendum ‚· so in ἓ 6 adscribi, ἓ 9 adservatae, ἓ ¹2 adspec-
tum, ἓ ²54 adstzttsset. It is impossible to lay down rules for the insertion
or omission of d in ad before sueceeding s.—Affluenti,· so ἓ 5 affuit, ἓ 6
offic-rebatur, g 12 afferre. It seems certain that the Latius objected to the
mund os d, b, before ‚fl—Exspectare ; so ἓ 14 exsili, ἓ 15 exstitisse.
Usage m these words probably varied, but the form axs- preponderated. ,
