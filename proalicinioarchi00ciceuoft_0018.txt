the party of L. Lucullus in the Senate, and his dissent from the
partisans of Pompeius. The last-named section was naturally
distasteful to Cicero, because while it professed to be conserva·
tive and aristocratic, it actually used the weapons of demagogism
and mob-rule. The old aristocratic party, attached to orderly
and constitutional government‚ was now chiefly represented in
the Senate by the friends of LuculluS. But, in addition to his
natural predilection for the party of Lucullus, Cicero had private
and personal reasons sor shewing his attachment to it by de-
fending Archias. Since Cicero had laid down his consulship,
he had been bitterly attacked by men who professed to be
friends of Pompeius and had been countenanced by him, for
the measures taken to suppress the Catilinarians. They had
tried to establish Pompeius as a dictator for the purpose of
punishing Cicero and the Senate, and the attempt had only
been crushed by extreme measures on the part of the Senate.
Pompeius himself had treated Cicero very· coldly during the
troubles of the year 63 Β. C.

The arguments in the case of Archias require but little exa-
mination. The grounds on which Gratius attacked Archias
were two: first and chiefly, because he could not bring complete
documentary evidence to prove his original admission to the
citizenship; secondly, because he had never been enrolled as a
citizen on the census-register. Gratius does not seem to have de-
nied that Archias had fulfilled two of the three conditions required
by the Lex Plautia Papiria¹3 he had a settled habitation at
Rome; he had given in his name to the praetor within sixty
days after the passing of the law, and his name was still to be

seen, free from erasure, on the books of Metellus². But the
town archives of Heraclia had perished by fire in the Social war,
so Gratius contended that the admission of Archias as citizen

of Heraclia, on which he based his claim to the Roman fran-
chise, could not be proved. This charge was easily refuted by
the testimony both of the corporation of Heraclia and of M. Lu-
cullus, who had actually witnessed and taken part in the sor·
malities. The other objection of Gratius, referring to the census,
