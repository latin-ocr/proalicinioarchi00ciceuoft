62 PRO ARCHIA POETA. §27.

28 Pingue etc.: cf. De Or. 111 44 cum sit quaedam certa vox Romani
generis urbisque propria, in qua nilzil offlndi, nilzz'l displicere, nillil
animadverti possit, nilcil sonare aut olere peregrinum, hanc sequamur
neque solum rusticam asperitatem, sed etiam pnegrinam insolentiam
sugere discamus, Brut. 2 59 Cotta sonabat subagreste quiddam planeque
subrusticum, Rep. 111 3, Lucr. 111 873 sincerum sonere. It is more
likely that ¹pingue means “heavy’', “stupid’'‚ than “rich”, i. e.
“high-flown , “extravagant''‚ as Halm thinks.

29 Dederit: Ad Att. 11 14, 2 vide quibus hominibus aures sint deditae
meae.

32 d tClon'a:= gloriae studio ,· so Tusc. 11 46 pueri serunt (dolorem) gloria
uc ι.

33 Illi: the well-known philosophers who prate most about despising
fame—chiefly Stoics and Epicureans. Cic. himself wrote a book De
gllcgzia} 34'l'he clause ipsi—inscribunt is almost exactly repeated in

P. 31.

ι In eo ipso .· “in regard to that very thing ”, rare for in ea {psa re. .

Nominari: sc. se, a change of construction from praedicari de se ;
cf. Ad Fam. X111 4, 3 ut te horter et suadeam (i. e. tibi).

5 Yemplorum—monumentorum .· built, as the c-ustom was, out of the
spoils taken by Brutus (surnamed Callaecus, consul 138 B. c.‚ conquered
the Lusitanians and Callaeci). One was a temple of Mars near the
Circus Flaminius containing a colossal statue of the god by Scopas
(Plin. Nat. Hist. XXXVI 5, 26). Attius (lived about 170—104 B-C.)‚
the great tragic Latin poet.

Iam: the force of this is “now we have got to an example no one
can dispute''. A good ex· of this use is Tusc. 1 2 iam illa quae natura
assecuti sunt etc.

ἡ 6 Fulvius: surnamed Nobilior, consul 189 Β. c.; he was scolded by
Cato for taking a poet with him to the seat of war (Tusc. 1 3). The

word ‚comite shews that Ennius was a member of the general’s cohors
or retmue.

7 Musis.- the temple was near the Circus Flaminius, and was
apparently dedicated to the goddesses under their Greek, and not
under their Latin name (Camenae).

8 ‘Propet almost before laying down their arms; coluerunt: “have'
honoured’' 3 poetarum nomen refers especially to Brutus. ’ For the
contrast between armati and togati (“in civil attire'') cf. Cic.'s famous
line Cedant arma togae, concedat laurea laudi.
