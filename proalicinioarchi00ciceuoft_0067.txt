done without the hope of fame ? 5 29. If we did not look beyond

the grave, no one would care to enter on the struggles and anxietiae os

public life. The hope of same spurs men on. ἕ 3ο. Many men have

been anxious to leave behind them statues of themselves, represen-

tations of their bodies: how much more anxious should we be to

llandl dowg to posterity a polished record of our thoughts and character?

§28.

ιι Me indicabo: Cic. jocularly uses an expression which is strictly
said of persons who, having committed a crime, give themselves up
Ξῗκὲξέυέιῖἒὲηῑιεες so De F m. 1 50 multi (sc. improbi) te consule se φεῖ

12 Quodam: indicates that the words amore glon‘ae are stronger than
are needed to meet the case.

14 Vobiscum simul: slightly pleonastic (as 30, p. 32, l. 1) but common

enough, although in such expressions edd. have osten wrongly ejected
· simul as Acad. 1 4. The senate, equites, and tribuni aerarii, from
which three bodies the juries were at this time chosen‚ sympathized
heartily, Cic. often tells us, with his attacks on the Catilinarian party,
many os whom were condemned in the courts.

15 Pro...etpr0...proque: cf. Verr. v 8 cum...et cum...cumque.

Universa re publica: “the general good os tbe country ”; re must
be taken separately from publica and allowed its suu force. Cf. In Cat.
zuzz- de summa salute vestra populique Romani dc universa re

16 Versibus: see Introd. p. to.
Quibus auditis·:=de quibus (versibus) cum audivissem ,· audire, legere
aliquem, are not uncommon phrases sor audire, legere de aliquo. So

Fam. 111 lo, 11 te enim, ut spero, prope diem consulem audiemus, Acad.
11 3 quos legisset. '

18 ’ Nulla virtus etc.: so v Phil. 35 (of Brutus) neque enim ullam mer·
cedem tanta virtus praeter hanc laudis gloriaeque desiderat.

⁰21 Curriculo: Acad. 1 44 brevia curricula vitae, Pro Sest. 47 vitae
brevem cursum, gloriae sempitermtm.

’ 22 In laboribus: the abl. with in after exercere is sar commonet than
the simple abl. Halm asks what the difference is in meaning between
the two constructions. It is easy to shew that they are not inter-
changeable, e.g. Liv. VI 22, 4 in captis exercuerevictcmam ; here the abl.
could not stand alone, nor could it in xl Phil. 8 exercere saevitiam non
solum in vivo, sed etiam in mortuo. On the other hand, the simple
abl. is necessary in such passages as Tibullus 11 1, 69 illic indocto
primum se exercuit arcu, Verg. Aen. 111 182 Iliacis exera'te satis.
Exercere is in the widest sense to train ‚· the training may be regarded
as being carried on by certain means or instmments when the simple
abl. foffiws, or wz'thin certain limits or over a certain field, when the
abl. wi 0in is used.
