42 PRO ARCHIA POETA. §8-
§⁸-

32 Nihil aliud nisi: sc. facimus or agimus. Some scholars deny that
there is such an ellipse; but in numerous passageS, as Pro Sulla 35,
Verr. V 58 Cic. inserts the verb agere or facere with nihil aliud nisi,
so it is fair to conclude that in passages like the present, and Pro Sest.
14, a verb is to be supplied. Cf. the very similar ellipse in οὐδὲν ἄλλο ἤ.

Civitate ac lege: = civitate Romana lege Plautia Papiria data.

Dicimus:= dicturi sumus, as often ς the repetition in dicimus dico
dicta est is clearly intentional. Causa dicta est: “our case is stated '’.

33 Grati: see Introd. p. 13.

P. 24.

1 l Heracliae: “at JJ.” ς not dependent on ascriptum ; see n. on 7,
. 2 .
⁷Tu eum .· see A ppendix B, p. 78.
2 Adest.- sc. nobis ; “we are supported by''. Lucullus appeared not
only as witness, but as advocatus (friend and supporter) of Archias.

Auctoritate : influence as a man of position3 religione: scrupulosity
about oaths3 fide .· veracity and honour.
3 Opima—scire.- the contrast (osten found in the Academica) is be·

tween knowledge founded on conjecture (δ’όξα), and knowledge founded
on certainty (ἐπιστήμη). Non...sed throughout the sentence=non modo,

sed etiam. ·

4 Egztcse: not to be taken literally. M. Lucullus could not actually
conduct the ceremony of conferring the franchise of Heraclia on Archias,
but he could and did bring it about by his influence3 his evidence
about the fact was therefore important.

A dsunt—venerunt .· for the asyndeton cf. Verr. v 154, a passage very
similar to this ; Adsunt enim Puteoli toti, frequentissimi venerunt ad hoc.

iudicium mercatores homines locupletes atque honesti, qui dicunt ......
6 R Publice testimonio: testimonials from corporations were common in
oman cour s.

7 ’ Ascriptum .· such citizens were called ascn‘pticii (De Nat. Deor. 111
39) to distinguish them from those who were citizens by birth.

Hic: “ at this point'’ ; tabulas .· “ records’'.

8 Italico bello: the war of 90, 89 13.c.‚ called by Horace Marsum
duellum, by Nepos bellum sociale. '

Omnes: note the emphasis given by the position of the word at the
end of the sentence, and ef. Acad. 1 14.

Est: remark est at the beginning of the sentence, not followed by
any connective particle3 this is unusual. The abruptness gives em·
phasis; “it is ridiculous ''-

Ad:= “in reply to''.

10 · Requirere: n. on 3, 1. 8 vobis non molestam.
