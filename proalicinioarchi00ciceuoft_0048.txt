44 PRO ARCHIA POETA. ξω.

24 Diligentius this word denotes minute painstaking caresulness in
work; here “ exactness ”.

Ad L. Lentulum a ad: no exact rule can be given for the repeti-
tion of prepositions, but generally when the repetition takes place, as
here, the two nouns are marked off from one another with greater dis-
tinctness and separateness than they would have if the second preposi-

tion were left out.

25 Iudices: probably a trial about citizenship. Lentulus, a praetor of
89 B.C.‚ is only known from this passage.

26 Litura: apparently an erasure he had been obliged to make in his
own reglster.

Nulla in litura: for reading see A ppendzzx B, p. 78.

27 tAesz-Ciytzlzi: n. ort 1, l. 6. Only the Roman name of Archias was
en er on e regis er. ·

ς 10.

ΞΒ Eius: one would expect huius from an advocate speaking about
a client present in court. But eius here means “the person so de-
scribed '’, i. e. by the title A. Licinius.

Civitate: the context shows that this means not the Roman fian·
chise, but the franchise of Heraclia. The argument is ‘fwhy should
you doubt the fact that Archias was enrolled citizen of Heraclia,
when it is clear that he is an enrolled citizen of other towns? Per-
haps you doubt this too, that is you admit that the towns open freely
their citizenship to men of low character and attainment while you doubt
the likelihood of their having opened it to my client, a man of the
highest ability ''. The argument is a reductio aa' absurdum.

29 Fuerit .· not sit, because the enrolment of citizens had long ceased in
these towns, since they had been incorporated with the Roman tribes.

So in 7, l. 27 ascm'ptifitissent.
30 Humili aliqua: βαναύσῳ τινι; aliquis like τις 'adds a contemptuous
indefiniteness to the epithet; cf. Acad. 11 32 desperatos aliquos.

31 Graecia: the context shows that Magna Graecia is especially meant3
so Tusc. Disp. v 66.
32 Credo .· when credo is ironical, as here, it generally stands in a

parenthesis, without influencing, as‘it does here, the construction of the
sentence. Cf. 25, l. 15 and 1. 17, and the use of οἶμαι in Gk.

33 Scaenicis artificibus: the Romans of the Republic always regarded>
the occupatiori of acting on the stage as incompatible with citizenship.
The word artifex· was applied even to sculptors and painterS‚ as well as
to singem, actors, dancers and the like.

P. 25.

1 Quid? this little anticipatory question like τί δε; in Gk. only serves
to draw special attention to the following sentence: “ what will you

say to the next question Ρ ”
