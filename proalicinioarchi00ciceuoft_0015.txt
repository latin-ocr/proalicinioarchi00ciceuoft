he now turned this into Greek and sent it to Archias, who

Cicero asserted, was deterred from writing by his envious ad-

For twenty-seven years aster the passing of the Lex Plautia
Papin'a (i. e. from 89 to 62 13.C.)‚ Archias enjoyed the privileges
of a Roman citizen without molestation. He made his own

will and testament in accordance with the forms of the Roman
Law, in the lull expectation that the Roman courts would

recognise its validity. As a mle, only full Roman citizens could
inherit the property of Roman citizens ³, and Archias had taken

carried on for Sulla's favour⁵, and had been embittered by the
brilliant career of L. Lucullus in the East. When the latter
returned to Rome, a large party in the Senate looked to him
to deliver them from the tyranny of their professed champion
Pompeius· The partisans of the two waged bitter war, and

of his opposition had much effect in driving Pompeius into
the arms os Caesar and Crassus. For three years a series of
