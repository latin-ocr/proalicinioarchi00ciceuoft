68 PRO ARCHIA POETA.

no scholar thinks of suspecting. When the De Republica was re·
covered, within the present century, lt was found that Cicero had
actually used many expressions which till then were thought not to
be Ciceronian. We must therefore look narrowly into the rare usages
in the Pro Archia to see whether they are in themselves objecdonable,
as well as rare. In the following notes Ι have omitted all expressions

which have been attacked in ignorance by scholars like Schroeter. 1·

shall leave the reader to draw his own conelusions about the amount
of suspicion which the language of the Pro Archia casts on its

genuineness.

§L

Quoad longissime. In the n. it was pointed out that quoad is joined
with longz‘m‘me in one passage of Livy, where it is still allowed to
stand in the best texts. Undoubtedly quoad is elsewhere not defined
by an adverb, but in no case is further definition so natural as when
the extreme limit of mental or natural vision is to be indicated, and both
in Cicero and in Livy (quoad longissime conspectum oculi ferebant) this
is the case. Stuerenburg points out that we have close parallels in
ut maxime, and quantus joined with maximus, as it is frequently in
Livy, e. g. XXX 2 5 quanto maximo impetu possent. If however the
expression quoad longissime be still objected to, it would be easy to
suppose quoad a corruption for quo, as it frequently is in MSS. ’

Vel in primis. Found according to Stuer. in Tusc. 111 12 and
nowhere else in Latin. Yet vel so constantly goes with maxime and
other superlative adverbs, and in primis is so nearly equivalent to a
superlative adverb, that no objection can be made to the phrase.

Prope suo iure. These phrases, suo, meo, tuo, iure, are probably
used elsewhere without any qualisying word such as prope. Yet there
is absolutely nothing in the nature of the phrase to justisy suspicion3
its non-occurrence elsewhere must be a mere accident. The meaning
is the same as if Cic. had said prope or paene dixerim. [See Addenda.]

Inde usque. This is also, by accident, a ἅπαξ λεγόμενον, as are
the phrases usque istim in Ad Att. 1 14, 4 and usque adhuc in Rep.

11 36. [See Addenda.]

Hortata. This is found only once elsewhere in Cic„ viz. Ad Fam.
xm 29, 7, but the word is of perfectly good formation. If it had
occurred in any case but the abl. sing., it would have been possible
to say at once that Cic. did not write it. Not till Tacitus (Ann. 1
70) is any other case found.

ἓξ

Ex pueris excessit. This phrase certainly cannot be exactly paralleled
in Latin, but see n. It is perfectly permissible as an imitation of ἐκ
παίδων, since Cic. is speaking of a Greek.
