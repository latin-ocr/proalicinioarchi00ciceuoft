An: cf. n. on 17, L 25. The form of the sentence is a little
irregular, since non, not nonne (after the preceding an), ought to stand
in the second branch, as in Tusc. v 4² and 104. Richter quotes an
ex. from De Nat. D. 11 17, in a very long and complex sentence.
The an is really out of place when the first branch of the sentence
merely states categorically an admitted fact3 it has passed into this
sor1n of the sentence from that form in which both the branches con·
tained interrogations.

Studiose reliquerunt: a condensed expression sor st. conquisiverunt
ut relinquerent.

Expressam etc.= “moulded and finished'’; often used of the fictile
or plastic arts, as expressam in cera imaginem (Plaut. Pseud. 1 1, 54),
hence very common in Cic. in metaphorical applications, e. g. 14, l. 2 ι,
l’ro Rab. Post. 4 cum magnitudine animi tum liberalitate vitam patres
expresserat (“had reproduced'’), Acad. 1 10 non verba sed vim Grae-
corum expresserunt (·‘represented'’ in translation). Remark that ex-

primere cannot be used to denote, like our word “express’'‚ the mere

fact of talking3 so sententiam exprimere for dicere is not Latin.
lam tum: i. e. even so far back as that time 3 so 11, 1. 11.

Spargere ac disseminare: both metaphors from tillage. So Pro
Plane. 56 disseminato dispersoque sermoni.

Partem .· Horace Od. 111 30, 6 non omnis· moriar multaque pars mei
vitabit Libitinam.

ἓξ 31, 32. Peroration. summm-y. ξ 3ῐ. Whether you look
to the modesty of Archias, his talent, or the strength of his case, you
must aequit him. You cannot be cruel to a divinely gifted poet, who
has eulogised your generals and your successes, but will reverence him

hope the remarks I have made on Archias’ talent and on literature in
general have been taken in good part.

Pudore: “honour”, i. e. the feeling of honour. .

Vetustate: vet. amicorum is an unusual expression for v. amicitiae
(Acad. 1 ι). It is very likely that Cic. did not intend vetustate to
go closely with amicorum, for the word is frequently used in a col-
loquial way without a genitive, as vetustate coniuncti (Ad Fam. x 10, 2),
magna vet. intercedit (ib. XI 16, 2).

Expetitum: cf. 22,l. 25.

Causa eius modi: parallel to pudore eo, ingenio tanto, so eius modi
is treated as though it were an indeclinable adjective, here=tali as
in 3, l. 13 and Verr. 11 187 aspicimus lituras eius modi quasi quaedam
volnera tabularum recentia. The passage, however, is almost as strange
as the well-known one of Tacitus l-list. 1 8 vir fizcundus et pacis
