person of L. Lucullus from the year 88 Β. C., when that general
first went to the East, to the time when he died (about 59 Β. c.).
Archias appears to have been alive in the year 44 Β. C., when he
must have been quite an old man¹. This is the last we hear

of him.

ξ 2. Cicero's connexion with Archias.

Cicero tells us that he could not recollect a time when he
had not known Archias, who had encouraged his boyish love
of learning and eloquence. The poet can scarcely have given
regular instruction to the young orator, but merely advice&
From 102 to 88 Β. C., Archias had lived in the midst of the circle
of Optz‘mates with whom Cicero was familiar, but it is not likely
that in later years the friendship between the two was very
close. L. Lucullus was only at Rome sor three years between
88 and 66 Β. C., in 79 when he was aedile, in 78 when he was
praetor, and in 74 when he was consul. Between him and
Cicero there was never a cordial intimacy3 their intercourse
was always cool‚ distant, and polite, arising from political agree-
ment rather than from personal liking. Just before this speech
was spoken (62 B.c.), Archias had begun a poem upon what
Cicero regarded as the noblest possible theme, the suppression
of the Catilinarian conspiracy³. Doubtless‚ as we shall see pre-
sently‚ the reasons which determined Cicero to defend Archias
were chiefly political, but he was of course glad also to place the
poet in his debt‚ and so hasten the completion of the poem. We
learn, however, that Cicero had reason to be dissatisfied with
the slowness of Archias in fulfilling his promise. Archias
spent his time in finishing a poem on the achievements of Lu-
cullus in the East⁴ ς he then purposed writing in honour of his
warm friends, the Metelli. So at the end of a year after the
speech, the poem on Cicero's consulship made no progress.
Cicero had himself written a Latin poem on the same subject ;
