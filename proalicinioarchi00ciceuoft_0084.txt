80 PRO ARCHIA POETA.

order or euphony. Thus Lambinus has §6 Pio eius filio, ἒ 17 tam agres-
ti animo (where see my nn.). Also many less important changes, as 5 6
longo satis, ἕ ¹5 laudibus effers, ibid. solere exsistere, ἓ 20 praeconium

facile, §⁴29 vita apsa, ξ 31 fidem acctpiatis.

The other readings Ι notice in order.

ς ¹. Possumus. This has better authority than possemus which
nearly all edd. write. The subj. is good, but by no means necessary.
§2- Ratio aut: Lamb. ac; see n. §8- 'Huius ...... venerunt: Lamb. puts
qui before huius ; Mommsen ejects venerunt, but see n. Ascriptum
Heracliensem: Lamb. ascrtptum Heracliae esse, but the omission of esse
aster verbs of thinking, speaking, etc. is common in. Cic.; cf. n. on p.
27, l. 13 liberalissimam iudicarem. ξ 9. An domicilium: so MSS, but
many edd. read At removing the note of interrogation, and making the
sentence a statement by Cic. of an objection brought by his opponent.
But the question suits ἓ 8 Heraclz'aene etc. better, and the objection is not
one likely to have been made by Gratius. Many edd. omit the note of
interrogation after habuit, but the whole passage has more point if
is qui—collocavit be made a question containing the answer to the former
question. Lamb. altered Romae into in ltalia to suit ἓ 7.. An non
est professus: so E P, but Bait. again reads at with other MSS. ΤΙιε
arguments already given tell against this at also. For an non answered
by immo cf. Ad Att. 1x 7, 4. ς 10. in civitatibus: the in is necessary,
though omitted by Lamb. Impertz'ebant: Orelli ed. 1 wrote impertieban-
tur, a deponent verb foreign to Cic. ἓ 1 t. revincetur: Lamb. convince-
tur: see p. 69. 5 12. A nullius: Orelli ed. 1 ab, a total mistake, as
is his abfutura for afutura in ἓ 30. ξ 13. alveolo: many edd. aleae,·
see n. ἓ ¹4· suasissem: Lamb. persuasissem ,· see n. Obisczzvsem:
Halm coniecissem,⁴ but there is scarcely any verb ordinarily taking a
dative which Cic. does not occasionally use with in and accusative.
ἓ 16. many edd. modestissimos sor moderatissimos. ς’ 17. nos animorum.-
al. hos,· see n. ξ 18. atque sic: Lamb. Or. ed. 1 atqui ; but an
adversative particle is out of place. Inflari: Lamb. afflari; see p. 69.
Pervenz‘ret: L. needlessly pervenirent. ἓ 19. suum vindicant: L. ut
suum ; see n. Delubrum eius: L. ei, but d. alicuius dedicare is quite
as good Latin as d. alicuid. ς 21. servatam: L. conservatam. Quae
ortorum ‚· L. Or. ed. 1 needlessly quare quorum. ἕ 26. praedz‘cari de
se. L. omits de, but de aliquo praedicare aliquid is common enough.
§⁴28. in laboribus: L. om. z'n,· see n. ἓ 29. dimittendam: the phrase
dum'ttcre commemoratzonem nominis cum vitae tempore seems sensible
enough but is suspected by Orelli ed. 1, altered by L. into dimetiendam
by Bergk into dimetandam; but what sense is there in speaking of
ᾗ· measuring out the same of a name parallel with the duration of a
hse”? ι §30- An statuas: L. an cum, a mistake3 see my nn. §31-
cum dzgmtate tum: L. Or. 1 tum...tum. apparently from a notion that
the phrase is better than cum...tmn. The only difference is that cum
throws dzgmtate into greater prominence than vestustate, while tum...tum
would leave both words equally prominent. Summarum: L. as.; see
n. lngenizs: negotiis is an inferior variant adopted by L. Or. ed. Ι,

so {audam sor laudis below. Itaque: L. Or. atque, though itaque=e1
nra is very common.
