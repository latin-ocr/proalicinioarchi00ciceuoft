Haec .· put here for the usual eadem, because these studia are the
theme of the present speech.

Latio: not to be taken as having a territorial meaning, but as
referring to the nomen Latinum in Italy. In a remarkable passage
(De Or. 111 43) Cic. implies that the general culture of the Latin towns
and colonies before the Social war was higber than that of Rome. The
fizbula togata of Titinius and his successors was a genuine Latin and
not Roman product. [See Mommsen, Hist. B. 111 c.14.]

33 Et Tarentini: notice that the et corresponds to the et before omnes
be10w, and not to the et before Regini. Mommsen believes (from
Velleius Paterculus 1 15, 4) that Tarentum became a Roman burgess-
colony in 122 Β. c. and so ceased to be a civitas foederata. If this is
so, the town could not have conferred any franchise on Archias. But
I believe Mommsen is mistaken; the colony called Neptunia most
likely was founded in the ager Tarentinus, leaving the city itself
unaffected. By Roman law, no Roman could be a citizen of his own
city and of other cities at t’he same time, but the provincials had no

such rule- . see Pro Balbo 29.
