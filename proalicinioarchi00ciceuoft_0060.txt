56 PRO ARCHIA POETA. §20.

2⁴ Et Cimbricas res: this et should be followed by another et intro-
ducing lllz'tlzridaticum bellum, but the construction is interrupted by
neque enim etc. and resumed by vero. Such slight anacolutha are com-
mon in Cic. where et, et—aut, aut—vel, vel—sive, sive—alius, alius—
alter, alter and the like ought to stand, and the broken construction is
generally pieked up by vero (as in Acad. 1 7, where see my n.) autem,
or the like. [There is a thorough exposition of these anacolutha in -
Appendix I. to Madvig’s edition of the De F inibus]

25 attzgrit: n. on 17, 1. 2ο.

C. Mario etc.: Sallust Bell. Iug. 85 makes Marius boast of his
want of education—“quae illi littera& ego militando didici etc.’' For
durior “somewhat rude '' cf. duro in 17, 1. 23. Ad in the sense “as
regards” is especially common after adjectives. So De Leg. 11 33
multa ad veritatem mirabilia ,· five exx. occur in one sentence Pro
F ont. 43.

g 20.

26 Aversus a Μ. .·= ἄμουσος.

27, ›lsersz‘busn- so mandare litteris* (De Or. 11 52), monumentis (Acad.
11 2 .

28 Praeconium .· so praeconem 24, 1. 7.

²9 Daelletse aiunt: such a phrase as dzllerse dicunt} occurs, according to
Stuerenburg‚ in one passage only, Prfflssaffss? [See Addenda]

Cum quaereretur .· Roby, Gram. Bk. IV c. 22 (F), gives a clear classi-
fication of subjunctives like this, which he names “subj. of attendant
circumstances”. They are esp. common in Cic. The following form
is frequent, De Or. 11 22 saepe e socero meo audivi, cum diceret.

30 Acroama: “artiste''; the word literally means “a thing heard '’,

and was especially applied to music : so in Suet. Vesp. 19 vetera acroa-
mata=old pieces of music, but the word also means a play, dance,
recitation‚ or any amusement of the sort ς next the person who acts,
dances, recites, or in other ways amuses, as here. In Nep. Att. 14 a
reader (anagnostes) is called an acroama, in Pro Sest. 116 an actor on
the stage. Cf. Polybius XVI 21 τὰ διὰ τῶν ἀκροαμάτων ,ᾀδόμενα παίγνια.

Vocem: sc. cantantis ,¹ the questioner was merely asking which· one

os the public actors or singers of the day Th. liked best. The story is
also told by Val. Max. V111 13. ’

31 Sua virtus, etc.: Xenophon Hier. 1 14 τοῦ μὲν ἡδίστου ἀκροάματος ,
ἐπαίνου οὔποτε σπανίζετε, Memorab. 11 1. 31 τοῦ δὲ πάντων ἡδίστου ἀκού-
σματος, ἐπαίνου σεαυτῆς, ἀνήκοος εἶ.

3² L. Plotium: Suet. De Rhet. 2 preserves part of a letter of Cic.
which describes L. Plotius as the first to set up a school of rhetoric
where declamation was practised in Latin. Cic„ then a youth, was
prevented from attending by the conservative prejudices of his friends
who thought* exercises in Greek more valuable.
