16 INTRODUCTJON.

Had the prosecutor gained his case, he· would have done Archias
little harm, forthere were many means open to him by which
he could re-establish his citizenship. Gratius apparently did
not press for a distinct penalty on the ground of any overt acts
committed by Archias in the character of a citizen; what he
desit-ed was such a declaration from the court as would exile
the defendant from Rome, and ensure a separation, which could
only be temporary, between Lucullus and a life-long friend.

As we do not know the exact'provisions of the Papian law,
we cannot be certain how the court before which Archias was
tried· was constituted. If the law did not establish a special
court for trying alienS, the case must have been brought before
one of the standing criminal courts or commissions which in
their final form were established by Su11a1. The most likely
one to have been used is that which tried offences de maiestate,
a very indefinite phrase covering all shades of treason‚ sedition,
and opposition to the established order of government. A
scholiast has preserved the fact that the presiding judge was
Q. Cicero, the brother of Marcus. The facts alleged by scho-
liasts are often the guesses of men in no better position for
guessing than modern scholars; but in this instance we may
fairly trust the tradition, for it agrees well with the hints con-
tained in the speech2. Q. Cicero was himself a poet and an
admirer of Greek learning, and therefore likely to pardon his
brother's discursive eulogies of literature,

The number of the jury was no doubt fixed by the Papian
law. The members would naturally be chosen by lot from
among the selecti iudices, who at this time, under the law of
Cotta (B. C. 70), were drawn from the Senate, equites, and tribuni
aeran‘i.

The date of the speech3 is fixed by the year of Q. Cicero's
