17 Sepulchra Scipionum: the famous tomb, the inscriptions on which
were partly recovered early in the 17th and again at the end of the
18th cent. and are now in the Vatican. For Ennius’ statue cf. Liv.
XXXVIII 56, 4 Romae exlra portam Capenam in Scipionum monumento
tres statuae sunt, quarum duae P. et L. Scipionum a'icuntur esse, tertia
poetae Q. Ennii. A fragment of Suetonius, preserved by jerome‚ states
that Ennius was buried in the tomb. The custom of making room
for friends in the family grave was common among the Romans, but
Mommsen (Corp. Inscr. vol. 1. p. 12) shews reason for doubting the
statement os Suet. Pliny, however, Nat. Hist. VII 114 (a passage not
noticed by Mommsen), seems to imply that one of the tituli on the tomb
made mention of Ennius; cf. also Ovid. Ars Am. III 409 Ennius
emeruit Calabris in montibus ortus Contiguus poni, Scipio magne, tibi.

18 Ex mannore: when the tomb was opened in ¹780 two heads of
{ffssffggglgound' one of stone such as is got near Rome, the other of

At eis laudibus: i.e. the praise bestowed by Ennius on Scipio. Cf.
eiusdem laudir in 24, 1. 13. -

20 Huius: n. on 16, 1. 5. Cato the Censor brought back from Sar-
(ῧὲζι {rathis ssrain Q. Ennius, then a soldier in the Roman army 3 see

21 Rebus: here: “ state'’, “government''. So Acad. 11 57 Deli,
salvis illis rebus, i.e. when D. had an independent government.

22 Maximi, etc.: all eulogized in the Annales of Ennius, as command-
ers, chiefly in the second Punic war.

Omnium nostrum: observe that nostrum does not agree with, but
depends on omnium ; lit. “ of all of us''. [See my n. on Sull. 32.]

23 Fecerat: sc. carmina: Verg. Ecl. 111 86 Pollio et ipse facit nova car·
mina ‚· so 25, 1. 19 epigramma ficisset. Cf. ποιεῖν, ποιητής.

24 Rudinum .· of Rudiae, a Greek town in Calabria. Ennius received
the franchise through M. Fulvius Nobilior, consul of 189 13.C.‚ under
whom he served in Aetolia. E. says of himself in a line qu. by Cic. De
Or. III 168 nos sumus Romani qui fuimus ante Rudini. As Halm
points out, there is a contrast between Rudinum and Heracliensem,
Heraclia being a far more important place than Rudiae.

2 5 Civitatibus: if abl.= “in many states’'‚ since the abl. of the agent

cannot follow a passive participle in Cic. without ab ‚· nor can the dat. ·

take its place, so that if civilatibus be dat. the meaning must be “ for, in
the eyes of, many states”. In xl Phil. 24, where all the MSS have pro-
vinciae multis expetztae Halm (Orelli ed. 11) now inserts a before multis,
and it is not unlikely that the preposition ought to be inserted in our
passage. In face, however, of the numerous exx. of dat. after passive
participles collected by Draeger, Historische Syntax, I. p. 395, many of
which are nearly if not quite as strange as civitatibus here (supposing it
to be dat), 1 do not venture to make any alteration.
