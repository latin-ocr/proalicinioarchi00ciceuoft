Cicero’s speeches (in Orelli ed. α). The chief authorities followed
by Baiter are (r) G (“ Codex Gembiacensir nunc Bmxellenszlr'‘), a
parchment MS assigned to the xuth century. (α) Ε (⁸⁸ Codex Er-
fiertensis nunc Berolinenszw). (3) Ρ (“Lectiones a P. Pithoeo ad mar-

, Omissions frequently occur in MSS when a word is repeated, and
the eye of the transcribet has passed on srom the first occurrence of
the word to the second, dropping the words that lie in between. Of
this source of error we have some excellent examples in the MSS os
the Pro Archia. Thus in 5 10 the word modo occurs twice over3 P
therefore omits the words from post civitatem to aliquo modo inclusive.
In 5 ια animos occurs twice, so E and P omit the words doctrina
excolamus autferre animos. Again, in 5 15 sine doctrina is repeated ;
E and P leave out from naturae apsius to sine doctrina, while P is
further deceived by doctrinam a little lower down, and passes over
everything till the next sentence, beginning atque idem. In 5 ιι
Ε has been misled by the repetition of Romanorum, and neglects the
words from iure esse to civium Romanorum.

Sometimes slight resemblances between successive words have
caused one or other to drop out. Thus G E P omit ante after annis
in 5 93 the praenomen of Lucullus is not given by the MSS in 5 αι
L. Lucullo imperante, but must be supplied, because in the numerous
passages where this general is spoken of by Cic. the praenomen is
nearly if not quite always given. So M. has dropped out before
Catonem in 5 16.

Small words—promum, conjunctions, prepositions and est, are very
apt to disappear. Thus E omits milei in 5 4, hic in 5 11, while P
does not give nobis in 5 18. Cum, corresponding to tum, has vanished
in E (5 5) an‘d in P (5 6). No words so fre uently disappear as et
and que, so et before aut in E (5 10) and que a ter colendam (5 16) in
all the MSS. The last example is important, because it is well uscer-
tained that in Cic. at least two nouus, adjectives, participles, or
adverbs, cannot stand side by side without the copula unless they
distinctly form pairs, like manibus pedibu& So in Acad. 1 23 multorum
magnorum, 1 1 varie copiose are rightly altered by edd. though where
three words are strung together the copula is constantly omitted, as
in Acad. 11 63 memoriter, accurate, copiose. Prob. in ought to be in-
serted in 7 1. 27 and 12 1. 273 see nn. Est was easily dropped
out, because it was written st and closely attached to the preceding
word; if that word ended with s, the single letter t was the only sign
of the presence of est. Cic. very rarely uses a passive or deponent
participle without est for the perfect tense of the verb; hence most
edd. (though not Baiter) have rightly restored est aster classis· in 5 αι,
and 1 have thought right to restore it in 5 9 aiter professus. In ἓ 13
edd. read in me est, though MSS omit est, because the substantive
