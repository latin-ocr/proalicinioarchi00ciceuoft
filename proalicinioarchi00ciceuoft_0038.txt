34 PRO ARCHIA POETA. 31.

qua...esse may be scanned as a hexameter, but the oin medzocn'ter was
always short in prose.

3 Infitzor .· = nego, to suit confiteor below.
Huiusce rei: i. e. dicendi, as in 2 1. 18 and De Or. 1 113.

4 Ratio: observe the succession; ingenium (natural abssity), ex·
ercitatio (acquired readiness), ratio (knowledge of theoretical princi·
ples). These are the three requisites sor perfect oratory ς see De Or.
1 14 <where ars=ratio)‚ Quint. 111 5, 1 facultas orandi consummatur
natura (=ingem'o), arte (=ratione), exercitatione. Notice aut...aut sor
et...et, to increase the show of modesty. Ratio and exercitatio are osten
contrasted, as De Or. 111 80, 93. ’

Artium: all literature, but especially philosophy. Cic. constantly
insists on general culture as essential to the orator ι e-g. Orator 1 13— 120.

5 Confiteor: Roman juries, like some English solicitors‚ looked on the
-literary barrister as unpractical ; hence the saltering way in which Cic.
owns to a knowledge of Greek literature in passages like Pro Mur. 63.
For Cic.'s studies see my Introd. to the Academica. Note the collo-
cation of words in this clause.

Aetam-:vitam so often, as De Fin. 11 87.

6 Earum rerum: note that Cic. avoids the gen. dat. abl. plur. neut.
of is and qui, as being ambiguous, unless succeeded by some word
which clearly shows the gender.

Vel in primis': see Appendix A, p. 68.
A. Licinius: some MSS wrongly add Archias ; Cic. craftily assumes
here and 41. 17 that Archias is really a citizen, by using his Latin name.

7 Fructum...repetere: legal phrases3 sructus=rent or interest. So
repetunt in 191. 17.

Prope suo iure: “by an almost indefeasible right ”. As in meo,

tuo iure, the possessive pron. implies that the right is acknowledged ‚-

cf. 18 (p. 281. 8). [See App. A, p. 68.]

8 Quoad longai-ime: a rare phrase, now read doubtfully in Liv. 1 18,
8 (al. quo l.). [See'App. A, p. 68.]

9 ’ Memoriam recordari: “ call to mind my earliest recollections ’'.
Dle Or. 1 4 memoriae recordatio. Observe the emphatic position of
u timam.

10 Inde usque: see Appendix· A, p. 68.

Repetens: often thus useffas neut. verb 3 so Acad. 11 13, Verg.
Aen. 1 372 prima repetens ab origine. .
Principem ad: so x Phil. 24 principem ad conatum, Pro Sulla 9.

n Suscipiendam...ingrediendam .· the contrast is between adopting a
resolve and beginning to put it into practice3 cf. Ad Fam. v 12, 2
susceptarum rerum ac iam institutarum, also Ad Att. 1 19, 6.

Rationem: here = “ methodical pursuit’'.

12 Hortata: rare and only used in ablat. sing. like many other noune
whose stems end in ·u, e.g. natu, algu. [See App. A, p. 68.]
