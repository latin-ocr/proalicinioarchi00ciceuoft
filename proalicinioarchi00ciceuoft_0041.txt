not, while the second does presuppose opposition on the part of the
person who grants the request before he signifies his permission.

became a famous poet. ἓ 5. He came to Italy and after an enthu-
siastic reception settled at Rome, making the acquaintance of man
noble Romans, especially the Luculli. 5 6. When on a jonmey wi
M. Lucullus, he was enrolled citizen of Heraclia. ὅ 7. This gave
him a title to the Roman citizenship under the statute of Silvanus and
Carbo, with the requirements of which he fully complied.

Ex pueris excessit: this phrase is imitated by Cic. from the Greek
ἐκ παίδων ἐξελθεῖν, and is nowhere else found in Latin. But Terence
Andria 1 1, ‘24 (a line Cic. knew well—see De Or. 11 326) has is,
postquam excessit ex ephebis, cf. the line of Naevius (Ribbeck, Comicorum
Fragmenta) neque admodum a pueris apscessit neque admodum adulescen-
tulust. See n. on praetextatus in 5, 1. 8.

Ad humanitatem informari: literally “to be moulded (so conformata
r, 1, 13) with a view to, so as to produce culture’'. This is the so·called
final use of ad, not found after informare elsewhere in Latin. Cic.
has once (De Or. 111 58) fingi ad humanitatem, and Cornificius
ad Herennium lv 31 conformare ad. Cf. Plaut. Most. 1 2, 41parant

celebri: “populons”‚ “much frequented ”. The tiro must notice
that Cic. never uses celeber in our sense of ‘ ‘famous '’. Res celeberrima is
with him a “fact that many speak of”. The application of celeber to
persons or names (homo celeber, nomen celebre) begins with Livy. Cic.
