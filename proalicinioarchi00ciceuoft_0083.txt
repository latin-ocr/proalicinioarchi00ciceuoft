5 15. Est certum quid .- MSS quod which may just possibly be right,
though it is not likely.

5 16. Animi remissionem .· MSS animadversaebnem, which makes no
sense. Alunt .· MSS agunt, which cannot mean ‘⁴ promote ’'‚ ‘⁸ advance ''‚
as edd. used to interpret it. Al. acuunt.

ἕ 21. Efferuntur: MSS haec-seruntur, which many scholars suppose
to point to an old form ecferuntur.

g 22. Ex marmore. At eis : MSS e or et marmoratae. The correc-
tion is old, except ex sor e.

ἕ 23. Eodem .· G oddly eandem.
ἕ 24. Fortunam .· E forte owing to the ending of vinate-
ἕ 25. Sed ea condicione: MSS sub; see n.

ἓ 26. In eis: so Madvig for illis (without in), rightly, as the dative
would not follow inscribere in Cic. Moreover Ammianus Marcellinus
quotes the passage with the reading in his.

ἓ 27. T ogati .· G E locati.

§28. Huiusce: so some MSS, though most have huius aeque or atque.

Adhortatus sum: so E, but G has adortavi, P hortavi, whence
Klotz followed by Baiter and Halm adornavi. Ι oennot believe this
right ; adornare aliquem ad aliquam rem in the sense ‘⁶ to equip a man
for a particular thing ” cannot be Latin. The reading adoravi which is
common, is still worse. 1 think we have a transition in G and P from
a deponent to an active form, similar to the transitions from passive to
active quoted on p. 77.

b ἔρειο. Aliquam mei: many MSS aliquam animi mei, evidently
a sur .

Parvi: E pravi.- see n.
ἓ 31. Vetustate: many MSS oddly vestustate.
’ Estque ex: Madv. rightly for isque est.
· T anto quantum .· MSS mostly quanto, an impossible attraction.

§ 32. Quae fere a mea iudicialique: so Ι write sor MSS quae ferme (or
firmo) a me iudicialique. For meaning see n. Sweeping alterations
have been introduced by many edd.

e. ‘188 readings wrong-ly departed from by editors.

From want of a full knowledge of Ciceronian Latinity, the earlier
editors often gave the preference to inferior readings, or introduced
alterations into the text from mistaken ideas concerning the Latin of
Cicero. Many of these readings kept their place in the text almost
down to the present time ; not a few of them are still retained in the
text now most widely used, the Teubner. A few of these readings are
mentioned below, with some unnecessary corrections of recent editors.

One class of changes deserves special mention. Old editms were
very fond of altering the collocation of words to suit their own idoes of
