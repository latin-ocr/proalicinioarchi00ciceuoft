54 PRO ARCHIA POETA. §18-

P. 28.

τ Accurate cogitateque: cf. De Or. 1 257 accuratae et meditatae com-
mentationes. Cogitate occurs apparently only here and in Plautus.

3 Veterum ; i. e. Graecorum.

Sic: slightly redundant, as ostem e. g. De Fin. 11 13 Stoici eam
(voluptatem) sic definiunt, sublationem animi sine ratione.

7 Constare: “are based upon'’, as, Nep. Att. 13 domum cuius amoenitas
non aedificio sed silva constabat. Draeger, Hist. Syntax 1 515 (who does
not refer to our passage), denies that Cic. ever uses constare or consistere
either in this sense or the sense “to consist of'’ without a preposition
(in or ex). I have been unable to find a parallel, and most probably
et before doctrina ought to be changed into ex. The simple abl. often

follows stare as Acad. 11 3 in eodem tanta fuit aequitas ut hodie stet
Asia Luculli institutis servandis.

Ipsa: n. on 13, p. 26, l. 2.

Mentis vim'bus excitari .· “is agitated by the force of his own mind”,
i.e. by no acquired faculty. Et is perhaps explanatory, as in De Or.
11 194 poetam bonum neminem sine inflammatione animorum exsistere

posse, et sine quodam afflatu quasi suroris. For quasi quodam n. on 2, .

§.Ilm and for the sense cf. Ovid's est deus in nobis, agitante calescimus
o.

9 IVoster: i. e. Latinus poeta, as opposed to Archias, the Greek. Cf.
{agn el‘.:t1{4a.nd Ennius noster in Lucr. 1 117; so Statius noster in'De

Sanctos: so 3¹» 1. 25, and cf. Ovid. Am. 111 9, 17 at sacri vates et
divom cura vocamur, Sunt etiam qui nos numen babere putent, Ars Am.
111 403 Quid petitur sacris nisi tantum filma poetz’s?... Cura deum
fucrant olim regumque poetae Sanctaque maiestas et erat venerabile
nomen Vatibus. The adjectives sacer and sanctus seem used in these
passages without distinction of meaning.

¹0 Dono atque munere.- it seems impossible to draw any distinction
in meaning between donum and munus. The phrase is possibly a
legal one; in English as in Latin legal phrases repetition is common3
e. . “use and wont’'. The law of Cincius sor the suppression of gift,-
taffing was called lex a'e donis et muneribus (De Or. 11 286), and the
expression donum munus (et omitted as in usus fructus, sarta tecta etc.)
was commonly used b( the Roman lawyers. Cf. Pro Cluent. 66 donis

gatis muneribusque of bribes), De Senect. 40 divino muneri ac
ono.

Esse videantur: Cic. was ridiculed in ancient times for frequently
ending his sentences with these words. Quintilian x 2, 18 says that
tiros in oratory thought themselves very Ciceronian if they only wound
up their sentences yvith esse videantur.
