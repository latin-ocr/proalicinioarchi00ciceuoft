78 PRO ARCHIA POETA.

d. Other muttum of ΗΒΕ readings Justly neglectea *by editors.

ἓ 2. Lambinus rightly read hnic uni for huic cuncti or huic cunti.
First huic was written huice (a form Cic. does not use), then a t was
inserted in uni (cf. p. 77) which led to cuncti.

g 3. Redis-simum is in S, and I prefer it to the reading lectissimum
uf other authorities, because the notion of “sternness,” “uprightness'’
suits better than the notion of “choiceness'' the whole run of the
passage, and especially quaestione legitima—iudicio publico—praetorem
populi Romani-severissimos iudices.

54. Condidicit. So I conjecture sor contigit. T and d, c and g
are constantly confused in MSS. Condidicit might easily pass into
condecit, contigit. In the whole sentence Cic. is speaking of Archias'
education. Condia‘icit implies that this education resulted in his sur-
passing his fellow·students. The objection to contzgrit is that it is never
followed by the infinitive in Cic. but always by ut with subjunctive.
Hence Lambinus read ei ut antecelleret.

Cunctaque Graecia. MSS have cunctaeque Graeciae, but the expression
partes cunctae Graeciae for cunctae partes Graeciae is impossible.

b Admiratio. MSS admirationem by mere attraction from exspectationem
a ove.

ἓ 5. Eum domum. P has in d. but the phrase in d. acc-ispere is very
doubtful in Cic.

Sed eliam lzoc etc. MSS read virtutis ut for vinulis est. If this were
written virtuttst the transition to virtutis ut would be easy. Also domus
for domum ; this Ι believe to have been an alteration consequent on the
reading esset for esse, the MSS having inserted t as in the exX. already
given (p. 77). MSS have prima fiat, the difference between this and
prima affuit is slight. Ι also give eandem for eadem of MSS and familiar-
iss-imam for familiarissima.. Ι believe the cardinal error of the tran·
scribers was writing esset for esse, which caused all the other altera·
tions.

56. M. Lucullo: MSS L. but in ἓ 8 Μ. which is far more likely.
Lambinus read Ciliciam for Siciliam, to suit the career of L. Lucullus.

5 8. Tu eum .· Halm sor MSS tum.

§9. Tabulis: ΕΡ oddly have talibus; cf. ἓ 10 cui for huic (Ρ).
Nulla in litura nomen : so Mommsen for nullam lituram in nomen.
This correction is better than nullam lituram in nomine, because itis
more likely that Cic. would speak of the name being written over an
erasure, than os an erasure being visible in the name.

ξ tr. Eis temporibus-...quem .· MSS quae which is impossible sor
quibus eum, which the sense would require.

Pro consule: an old correction for E praetore consule, G. p. r. et

consule, P :PR consule, most edd. praetore et consule. The o in pro was .

ῗεεέἀεηιαᾘγ dropped, and as pr. was a contractiori for praetor, further
¹rr r was easy.

ᾗ 12. Homine: E curiously nomine.
