praetorship, which we know to have been 62 Rc. The speech
itself shews that the consulship of M. Cicero was over¹, and if
the censors of the year 61 had been appointed, they would pro·
bably have been mentioned. The eulogy on L. Lucullus ², which
seems intentionally to avoid all allusion to the career of Pom-
peius in the East, gains point by being referred to the year 62
rather than to 61. In the latter year Cicero was striving to
effect a reconciliation with Pompeius³.

There can be no doubt that the case ended in an acquittal
of Archias. About a year after Cicero spoke of him as resident
at Rome⁴.

ξ 4. Merits and genuineness of the speech.

The first thing that strikes a modern reader is, that the
greater part of the speech has little to do with the legal point in
dispute⁵. Certainly no English Court would listen to a great
deal that Cicero says⁶; but it must not be forgotten that a
Roman pleader was bound to urge every thing, whether strictly
to the point or not, which could possibly influence the court in
favour of his client. The only measure of relevancy was the
patience of the jury, and in this respect the jury was not con-
trolled as a modern jury is by the presiding judge. Cicero’s
attractive description of the character of a literary man was,
according to Roman ideas, quite in place. It shewed what
services literary men could render, and what Archias had ren-
dered to the Roman State, and what a loss the community
would sustain if literature in general were discouraged, and
Archias in particular were removed. One end was thus gained
which Roman orators continually kept in view. Thte matter at
issue was made to appear as though it were not private and
personal, but one affecting the interests οξ the country at large.
