petty intrigues prevented Lucullus from celebrating a triumph
which no one in the whole history of Rome had more honestly
earned than he. At the last his triumph was only voted by the
Comitia T ributa owing to a strong personal canvass carried on
among the tribes by the most eminent senators¹.

Lucullus triumphed in the beginning of 63 Β. C.² The pro-
secution os Archias was a small skirmish arising out of the
battle about the triumph. A favourite mode of annoying a pro-
minent man at Rome was to enter vexatious prosecutions against
his friends. Political animosities were fought out in the courts
as much as in the Senate or Comitia. Many associations (soda-
litates, factiones) with organised bodies of spies (indices), and
informers (delatores), existed, which had more or less connexion
with the various political partieS, and made a business of pro-
secutions, for the sake of the legitimate and illegitimate gains
they brought³. Record of only two cases strictly resembling 'the
case of Archias has been preserved. ln both of these political
motives prompted the prosecution. One is the case of L. Corne-
lius Balbus, whom Cicero also defended, where the prosecutor
wished to harass Pompeius. In the other the defendant was a
freedman of the notorious Gabinius, who was himself being tried
in another court on the same day, and was acquitted. The jury
who were trying the freedman‚ vexed at hearing of the acquittal,
at once condemned the man for the sins of his master⁴.

As a weapon of attack against Archias, the enemies of Lucul-
