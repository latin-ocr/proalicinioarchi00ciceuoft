APPENDLY B. ς ι

tinued existence of qua re seems to point to the fact that the disconnected

ronunciation maintained its ground by the side of the other, and
ooking to the related expression ea re, 1 hesitate to write quare in Cic.
The separation tam diu seems also to imply the separation of quam diu

(ἓ 9).

2· Mag’wpere (ἓ 13), tantopere (ἕ 12) are certainly wrong; cs.
max-imo, minimo, nimio opere. Pro consule, not proconsule is regularly
found in inscriptions, even in those belonging to a time when the
nominative proconsul was recognised as a legitimate form. (This nom..
,like propraetor, occurs in one or two inscriptions at and before Cic.’s
time, but was probably not accepted by him.) With regard to res
publica (ἐξ 5, 28) the analogy of many expressions like res militaris,
pecuaria, uxoria, familiaris etc„ is in favour of the disconnected form
of writing. Res familiaris is so osten contrasted by Cic. with rcs
publim that he must have felt the words to be distinct. Cf. also Ad
Att. lx 7 res privatae—res lica and Ad Fam. 1 8 rei totius publicae.
The phrase ius iu‘randum( 8) is altogether uncertain. Plautus has
iurandum ius (Pseud. 1 2, 63).

2. Inflcxionalfhrms.

a. Genltives of nouus in -ius, -1um. Ingena· (ἕ ι), iudici, municipi
(ἓ 8), Appi, Gabini, Licini (5 9), exsili (ἓ 14), Rosci (ἓ 17), Atti (ξ 27),
imperi (ἓ ⁴28). So strong and clear is the evidence in favour of these
forms in Cic. and against the forms with -ii, that ‚it is astonishing
to find editors, on mere MSS authority, retaining -2‘i. - This form
was first brought into use in Latin literature by the elegiae writers
Propertius and Ovid, and never drove the other entirely out of the
written or spoken language. F ull materials for studying the matter may
be found in Corssen, Aussprache ed. 2, 11 705, Neue, Formenlehre 1 85
sq. ed. 2· How little value is to be attached to the MSS in such a matter
may be seen from the fact that the best of them sometimes give the form
in ·ii where the mette imperatively requires the form in ·i.

b. Accusatives plural of -1 stems. Auris (ἓ 5), Locrensis (ἓ 10),
gravis (ἓ 15), innumerabilis (ἓ 21), omnis (§§ 14, ²9)· It can be clearly
shewn (see Corssen 1 743) that in Cic.’s time usage varied between the
forms ἧς and -ἔς, but it is also clear that -is was the regular and ·cs the
exceptional form, so that by adopting the former we can make certain
of getting nearer Cic.’s actual writing than by adopting the latter, as
most editors do.

c. comune ot Greek names tn -δε, Achilli (ξ 24). The evidence
in favour of this form in Cic. and against the genitive in ·is is so strong,
and MSS are so likely to have corrupted the -i form into the -is form
that 1 should not hesitate to adopt the former generally. Madvig
(n. on De F in. 1 15) strongly inclines to this view, but feels bound to

bow to his MSS.

d. 'rho termination -um in nom. and aec. oro-mm, when u or
*proceden- Exiguum (ξ 1), suum (ἓ 7), vivum (ἕ 19). There is great
