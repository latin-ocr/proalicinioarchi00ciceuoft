time allotted to each of the occupations mentioned· So Pro Mur.
74 Romam· homines, qui tempora voluptatis labensque dispertiunt. Our
present passage is imitated by Quint. 1 12, 18.

fl

ο T empestivis earl J ’² i. e. beginning before the customary hour,
three o 'clock or so in the asternoon, and therefore “ protracted'ss Cf’.
De Senect. 4,6 Pro Mur. 13, Ad Att.1x 1, 3, in which last passage Cic.
describes himself as being evil spoken of in tenspestivis convivz'zs, i. e. in
dissolute society.

4 Quantum denique: at first sight denique seems to introduce not, as
it should, the last thing in the enumemtion, but the last but one.
However, the alveolus and the pila are regarded as mere subdivisions οὶ
one and the same mode of spending time. Alveolus (a rare word—-
diminutive of alveus) lit. “dice-box”, here--ludus alearum, a game
in bad repu'te at Rome, where it was condemned by many severe but
ineffectual laws (Hor. Od. 111 24, 58 vetita legibus alea). The game
with the pila was persectly respectable, and it is rather strange that it
should be coupled with dicing here.

5 Recolena'a: recolere lit. = “to revisit’' ;here= renovare, ‘⁶ to resresh
the memory about'’‚ as in De Or. 1 2 adeas artes quibus a pueris dediti
fuimus celebrandas inter nosque recolendas.

7 Crescit: “makes progress' ’ς so rising men are said crescere (Pro
Rosc. Am. 83, Pro Cluent. 77). For crescere ex Cic. sometimes uses
crescere de, as Verr. v 173.

Oratio ct facultas. apparently sor orationis facultas; or a comma
ῗὲῗξέιῷ be put at oratio and facultas taken closely with the words that

8 In meest: cf. 1,1. 1.

Periculis: used, as often, with a reference to criminal trials. sse
word is even used to denote a list or calendar of persons to be tried, as
Verr. 111 183 eorum hominum fidei tabulae publicae periculaque magistra-
tuum committuntur ; ib. 11 107 Sthenz'i periculo ; Nep. Epam. c. 8 ut in
periculo suo inscriberent (where Halm has sepulcro Wrongly). One of
the tituli of the Codex Theodosianus' is de sententiis e periculo recitandis.
The Eng. word‘ ‘dan e1·''(fr0m a Low Lat. word dominiarium) was
originally a legal wor ,cf. Chaucer Prologue (of the Sompnour) In
daunger had lte at lzis own assize T lte younge gurles of the diocia, i. e
within his jurisdiction or power of inflicting a fine (damnum). Hence
danger=debt‚ as Shakespeare Merchant of Venice Ν 1 you stand m'tlzin
his danger.

9 Illa .· the high moral principles detailed in the next sentence.

1 1 Suasissem: many edd. read persuasissent because 111 good Latin prose
suadere' is very rarely followed by infin. with or without acc. but usually
either by dat. of person with acc. of thing or by ut, ne with subj. 1 believe
that the clauses beginning nihil and ending ducenda are really epexe-
getical or explanatory of a suppressed pronominal accusative such as id,
